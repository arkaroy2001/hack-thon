        "summary": "Terry Almanza, a former Chicago police officer, stands behind a poster of her daughter, Sydney Schergen, who died in 2015 from a lethal dose of ecstasy. (Facebook photo)\n\n\nFirst in a series looking at drug-induced homicides\n\n\nTerry Almanza, a 28-year Chicago police officer, admits that she was a hovering mom after her daughter experimented with drugs.\n\n\nShe put software on her daughter's phone to track her whereabouts and read her texts.\n\n\nHer daughter, Sydney Schergen, had plenty of benefits, growing up in the Mount Greenwood neighborhood in Chicago and attending Catholic schools. She had a college scholarship to continue her volleyball career.\n\n\nHowever, a traumatic event from Sydney's childhood stayed with her and she looked to numb the pain, Terry Almanza said. Sydney was in counseling, as were she and her Chicago firefighter husband.\n\n\nIn 2013, at the age of 18, Sydney Schergen, looking to numb that pain, took a fatal dose of ecstasy and died of MDMA poisoning, her mother said.\n\n\n'Kids are supposed to learn from their mistakes, not die from them,' Terry Almanza said.\n\n\nWith her daughter dying of a fatal dose of methylenedioxymethamphetamine, Almanza expected Chicago police to find the offenders who sold her the deadly drugs. Chicago police said they were not going to investigate the case criminally.\n\n\n'They knew what took place was done criminally, that somebody did sell the drugs to her that killed her,' Almanza said. 'I was aggravated. Why was somebody not going to go to jail?'\n\n\nAlmanza went into action and started doing research. She found out about a seldom-used state statute that had been on the books since 1988, allowing for the criminal prosecution of drug-induced deaths.\n\n\nShe told Chicago police about the statute, but they still opted not to pursue charges.\n\n\n'I was not asking them to smear the lines because I was a police officer. My daughter died in Chicago. I wanted charges brought,' Almanza said. 'I met with the chief of the Chicago Police Department's Organized Crime Unit. I told him, ‘I'm not going away.''\n\n\n'I had to do what my heart was telling me to do,' Almanza said.\n\n\nShe continued to lobby the chief of CPD's Organized Crime Unit to pursue criminal charges.\n\n\n'He told me even if we do find the people, they are never going to admit to providing a lethal dose of MDMA,' Almanza said. 'I said, ‘Just try.''\n\n\nSixteen months later, Chicago police brought two suspects in for questioning, and they admitted supplying the lethal dose of MDMA to Sydney Schergen.\n\n\n'I wanted culpability. They knew what they sold was lethal to an inexperienced user,' Almanza said.\n\n\nBrent Tyssen of Midlothian pleaded guilty and was sentenced to six years in prison for selling Schergen the fatal drugs.\n\n\nTyssen's girlfriend, Cynthia Parker of Alsip, also plead guilty and was sentenced to probation. She was charged as a juvenile because she was 17 when Schergen's death occurred.\n\n\nWhile out on bond in the Sydney Schergen homicide case, Tyssen and Parker were arrested in Orland Park for allegedly trying to sell 110 hits of LSD to an undercover officer.\n\n\n'Persistence is not going to bring my child back, but these people don't stop,' Almanza said.\n\n\nNext week: A mother starts a movement",

        "summary": "FILE - Lindsay Powell, Democratic candidate in a special election to fill a vacant Pennsylvania House seat, visits with campaign workers on the Northside of Pittsburgh, Sept. 9, 2023. Democrats will retain their one-vote majority in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives after voters in Pittsburgh... (Associated Press)\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Democrats will retain their one-vote majority in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives after voters in Pittsburgh on Tuesday elected former congressional aide Lindsay Powell.\n\nPowell's victory gives Democrats a 102-101 majority in the House. Republicans have a 28-22 majority in the Senate, creating a divided Legislature that has kept Democrats from passing priorities such as broadened protections for LGBTQ+ people and gun control measures and Republicans from wins on issues including school vouchers.\n\nThe divided Legislature has also meant Republican senators have been unable to take to voters proposed constitutional amendments limiting the governor's power and implementing voter ID.\n\nMost recently the division has mired the state in a two-month budget stalemate after negotiations soured over education funding, in part because of the voucher debate.\n\nPowell identified affordable and dignified housing, a strong local economy and community assets such as robust recreation centers, libraries and strong infrastructure as top issues. Housing, she said, was a particular concern. People feel displaced by rising costs and seniors want to stay in their homes.\n\n'I'm grateful. As someone who's been a lifelong public servant, this is the highest honor of my life, and I am so excited to be able to work on behalf of every single one of us,' she said in an interview Tuesday night.\n\nPowell, 32, is the director of workforce strategies for InnovatePGH, a public-private partnership aimed at making the city a leading tech hub. She previously worked in Washington, D.C., for U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries.\n\n'I joke, but truly I've had the honor of holding every job in government except this one,' she said previously.\n\nPowell will fill the vacancy left by progressive Democrat Sara Innamorato, who resigned in July to pursue local office in Allegheny County. She defeated Republican Erin Connolly Autenreith in the heavily Democratic district.\n\nAutenreith said in a phone interview Tuesday night that she hopes the Legislature tackles her top priorities — funding for police, improvements in education and increasing jobs in Allegheny County. She hopes to continue working with Republican candidates in her role as Republican committee chair in Shaler.\n\nThe House is due back at the Capitol next week to resume work on a long-overdue state budget, though Powell's victory may not be certified until early October, a spokesperson for the county said.\n\nMajority Leader Rep. Matt Bradford said fellow Democratic lawmakers welcomed Powell to the House and 'we look forward to continuing our work as the majority to move our commonwealth forward.'",

        "summary": "Klebsiella pneumoniae (popularly known as KPC) is a little-known bacteria that causes a variety of afflictions, including pneumonia and UTIs, and which can be deadly.\n\"Hypervirulent\" strains of the bacteria which cause severe infections, and their multidrug-resistant cousins, are beginning to evolve together, which has raised public health concerns. Now a team of Hackensack Meridian Center for Discovery and Innovation (CDI) scientists have partnered with colleagues at the National Institutes of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) in a study which shows which strains are more likely to survive in human blood and serum - and which are more susceptible to the human immune system. \nThe study was published in mBio\n.\n\"This study is really about getting to know this emerging health threat,\" said Barry Kreiswirth, Ph.D., member of the CDI, assistant professor at the Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine, and one of the authors. \"It's just part of the groundwork we're laying to better understand, and fight, this germ.\"\nIn the century since it was first identified, K. pneumoniae has evolved many different strains. Among these are multi-drug-resistant varieties found mostly in health care settings - and which mostly strike people with compromised immune systems. The \"hypervirulent\" strains, which are found in healthy people outside hospitals, can cause severe infections - but respond to existing antibiotics.\nThe concern is when new strains show both traits: drug resistance and dangerous virulence.\nIn the latest study, the researchers assessed some of these new germ varieties, seeing how they respond to human white blood cells and serum in test tubes.\nTheir findings show that a vaccine approach could be feasible to combat the new threat. The data also showed that, so far, the healthy human immune system can effectively attack the new strains which show both drug resistance and hypervirulence. The effective immune response thus far could be explained by the \"molecular machinery\" required by both resistance and virulence could exact a \"fitness cost\" which inherently weakens it in the face of healthy white blood cell response.\nThe next step is to assess the immune response to the strains in mouse models, according to the paper.\nThough little-known beyond public health circles, K. pneumoniae has recently made national headlines. One outbreak of the germ at a hospital in Seattle reportedly sickened at least 31 and killed four over more than six months.",

        "summary": "ABC News\n\n\n(WASHINGTON) — In a new interview with ABC News' Linsey Davis on ABC News Live Prime, GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy discussed his views on climate change, race and racism in America and why he would not consider being former President Donald Trump running mate if Trump beats him for their party's 2024 nomination.\n\n\nAn entrepreneur and commentator before launching his White House bid, Ramaswamy has seen his poll numbers rise this year — though he still trails far behind Trump, the front-runner — and has raised his profile in part through provocative and controversial comments, including calling for changing the U.S. Constitution to raise the voting age.\n\n\n'My goal is to speak the truth,' he told Davis.\n\n\nOn climate change\n\n\nRamaswamy, who has called himself an environmentalist while also being a staunch proponent of fracking and using fossil fuels in addition to carbon-free energy like nuclear, explained his position on climate change and policies to address rising global temperatures, telling Davis in the interview on Monday night that he believes the 'climate change agenda' is a 'hoax … more about pushing global equity' and deferring to China.\n\n\n'I think that with due respect … ‘Do you believe in climate change?' is not really a meaningful question because climate change has existed as long as the Earth has existed,' he said. 'Do I believe it is a fact that global surface temperatures are rising over the course of the last century of the last half century? Yes, I think that that is an established fact.'\n\n\nBut, as president, he would not take action to address the warming of the planet, he said.\n\n\n'The thing I'm going to do is actually drive human adaptation and mastery of changes in the climate through technological advances. I think that requires more, not less, use of fossil fuels more not less use of nuclear energy,' he said.\n\n\nHe also argued that cold temperatures kill more people than warm temperatures.\n\n\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, 'more than 19,000 Americans have died from cold-related causes since 1979, according to death certificates,' compared with 'more than 11,000 Americans [who] have died from heat-related causes' in that same period.\n\n\nHowever, research has also suggested that both excessive heat and freezing cold are closely tied to heart attacks.\n\n\nMore broadly, a report earlier this year found that man-made climate change — driven by the use of fossil fuels — was the main driver of dangerous heat waves in Europe and North America.\n\n\nDoctors recommend taking excessive heat warnings seriously. There are hundreds of deaths each year in the U.S. due to excessive heat, according to CDC WONDER, an online database, and scientists caution that the actual number of heat-related deaths is likely higher.\n\n\nBut Ramaswamy told Davis: 'The right answer to all temperature-related deaths is more plentiful and abundant access to fossil fuels.'\n\n\nWhite supremacy not a ‘top 50 problem' in US\n\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Davis raised a moment from the campaign trail when Ramaswamy questioned the existence of white supremacy in the United States at a stop in Iowa in August — supposing that he may meet a unicorn sooner than a white supremacist.\n\n\n'Are you really trying to say that white supremacists don't exist?' Davis asked.\n\n\n'Of course racism exists, but I do not think it is a top 50 problem in the United States of America. There was a point in our national history where we demanded a comprehensive response to racial inequality in this country. But, Linsey, that moment has now long past,' Ramaswamy said.\n\n\nHe was pressed by Davis in light of past mass shootings by 'self-identified white supremacists,' such as the gunman who attacked a predominantly Black church in South Carolina in 2015.\n\n\n'I want to end all of this violence. But the part of the problem is we're fostering more animus,' Ramaswamy said.\n\n\nHe has been vocal about what he contends is a counteractive focus on race, including through affirmative action and race-conscious policies that seek to address longstanding disparities in areas like university admissions.\n\n\n'I think the right way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race, to borrow from [Supreme Court Chief Justice] John Roberts. That has to be the path forward. I share the view of reviving colorblind meritocracy.'\n\n\nRamaswamy said in Iowa in August that Juneteenth, which marks the emancipation of slaves in the U.S., is a 'useless holiday' federalized 'under political duress.' Weeks earlier, he posted a video saying 'Happy Juneteenth' and 'we ought to celebrate how far we've come as a country.'\n\n\n'I'm just curious how you get to have it both ways,' Davis said.\n\n\n'Well, look, I believe in finding the positives wherever they exist,' Ramaswamy said, adding: 'I'd like to redefine and reorient it towards actually standing for American ideals that we aspire to.'\n\n\nNot interested in being VP\n\n\n'I think that the right role for me to play is be the next president of the United States of America. That's the only way I'm going to be able to unite this country,' Ramaswamy said when asked if he would hypothetically be Trump's vice presidential pick — an option Trump has suggested he would consider.\n\n\n'I've said it in multiple forums that I would not take that job,' Ramaswamy told Davis.\n\n\n'I'll take him as my mentor, an adviser,' he said.\n\n\nABC News' Emily Shapiro contributed to this report.\n\n\nCopyright © 2023, .

        "summary": "KANSAS CITY NATIONAL SECURITY CAMPUS, Mo. (AP) — The U.S. will spend more than $750 billion over the next decade to revamp nearly every part of its aging nuclear defenses. Officials say they simply can't wait any longer — some systems and parts are more than 50 years old.\n\n\nFor now, it's up to young military troops and government technicians across the U.S. to maintain the existing bombs and related components. The jobs are exacting and often require a deft touch. That's because many of the maintenance tasks must be performed by hand. \n\n\nThe Associated Press was granted rare access to nuclear missile bases and weapons production facilities to see how technicians keep the arsenal working while starting the government's \nbiggest nuclear overhaul since the Cold War\n. \n\n\nThis is how they do it and who they are:\n\n\nSHAKE, RATTLE AND ROLL\n\n\nBecause the U.S. no longer conducts explosive nuclear tests, scientists are not exactly sure how aging warhead plutonium cores affect detonation. For more common parts, like the plastics and metals and wiring inside each detonator, there are also questions about how the years spent in warheads might affect their integrity.\n\n\nSo workers at the nation's nuclear labs and production sites spend a lot of time stressing and testing parts to make sure they're safe. At the Energy Department's \nKansas City National Security Campus\n, where warheads are maintained and made, technicians put components through endless tests. They heat weapons parts to extreme temperatures, drop them at speeds simulating a plane crash, shoot them at high velocity out of testing guns and rattle and shake them for hours on end. The tests are meant to simulate real world scenarios — from hurtling toward a target to being carted in an Air Force truck over a long, rutty road.\n\n\nTechnicians at the \nLos Alamos National Lab\n conduct similar evaluations, putting plutonium under extreme stress, heat and pressure to ensure it is stable enough to blow up as intended. Just like the technicians in Kansas City, the ones in Los Alamos closely examine the tested parts and radioactive material to see if they caused any damage. \n\n\nRELYING ON OLD BLUEPRINTS \n\n\nThe lack of explosive tests — banned since the George H.W. Bush administration by an international treaty — has also meant that the scientists have been forced to rely on warhead designs that were created many decades ago. \n\n\nThat's because each of those original designs had been certified, and the best way to certify a weapon works as designed is to blow it up. Changing even one component introduces uncertainty. \n\n\nFurther complicating matters — because the weapons are so old — many of those original manufacturers and contractors have gone out of business. That has forced the nation's nuclear labs to reverse engineer old parts, such as a peroxide that was used to treat warhead parts, but is no longer in production. So lab technicians are working to reinvent it. \n\n\nRe-engineering parts is getting easier with advances in computer-aided design and 3D printing. Kansas City technicians are experimenting with 3D printers to create some warhead parts, such as a micro-honeycombed, rubbery layer that will serve as a cushion for a warhead radar systems. \n\n\nTHE WORKERS ARE YOUNGER THAN THE WARHEADS\n\n\nIt's not unusual to see a 50-year-old warhead guarded or maintained by someone just out of high school, and ultimate custody of a nuclear weapon can fall on the shoulders of a service member who's just 23. \n\n\nThat is what happened on a recent afternoon in Montana at \nMalmstrom Air Force Base\n, where Senior Airman Jacob Deas signed a paper assuming responsibility for an almost 3,000-pound Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile warhead, as it was lifted out of the Bravo-9 silo and escorted back to base for work. \n\n\nA sea swell of government retirements has meant that experience level in the civilian nuclear workforce has shifted dramatically. At the Kansas City campus, for example, just about 6% of the workforce has been there 30 years or more — and over 60% has been at the facility for five years or less. \n\n\nThat change has meant more women have joined the workforce, too. In the cavernous hallways between Kansas City's secured warhead workrooms are green and white nursing pods with a greeting: 'Welcome mothers.\" \n\n\nAt Los Alamos, workers' uniform allowance now covers sports bras. Why? Because underwire bras were not compatible with the secured facilities' many layers of metal detection and radiation monitoring. \n\n\n___\n\n\nThe Associated Press receives support for nuclear security coverage from \nthe Carnegie Corporation of New York\n and \nOutrider Foundation\n.

        "summary": "Cassandra Thomas\n \nAndrew Van Lew\n \n \n \nGraduate and international education is all about discoveries — the discovery of knowledge, the discovery of research and creative scholarship that improves lives and the discovery of new countries, cultures and people. The Graduate School and International Education is celebrating our students, faculty and staff that make discoveries happen at the U of A.\n \nGrowing up in northern California, Andrew Van Lew was immersed in a melting pot of different cultures from east Asia and Latin America, among others. That experience, along with traveling with his family across the border to Mexico and elsewhere, sparked a desire to live in and discover new places.\n \nThat desire led him to teach middle and high schoolers in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan as a Peace Corps volunteer, before becoming an ESL teacher and academic director of a foreign language institute in South Korea. Then it led him to another unlikely destination — Fayetteville, Arkansas, where he began as an international student adviser at the U of A before becoming the graduate and international recruitment coordinator in the Graduate School and International Education.\n \n\"I've always liked to travel, learn about other cultures and help people who wanted to improve their lives through education in other countries,\" he said. \"I've always liked to live in different places, and Arkansas is about as different as you can get from California.\"\n \nIn his role, Van Lew leads GSIE's recruiting efforts of graduate and international students, supervising a graduate recruiter while focusing personally on international recruitment. Recently, he traveled to Vietnam for a recruiting trip and is planning trips to the Bahamas, Panama and Bolivia this school year, where he helps prospective students discover the many benefits of studying at the U of A.\n \n\"At the U of A, you're more than just a number,\" he said. \"We have a strong international community supported by our International Students and Scholars Office. It's an incredibly safe campus and community as well. Our University Police Department is great with our international students — they have an annual Dodgeball and Donuts with UAPD officers. It's hard to be intimidated by a police officer when you've previously thrown rubber balls at them.\"\n \n\"And, you're studying at a Carnegie Research 1 university, which means you're not going to just learn about the past and present — you're going to help create the future,\" he continued, adding that he also talks to prospective students about the many job opportunities available in the Northwest Arkansas region after graduation.\n \nIt's a job perfectly suited for Van Lew, an extrovert by nature who enjoys the social interactions of the job.\n \n\"GSIE is a great place to work,\" he said. \"Everyone here is so collaborative and supportive. My supervisors and bosses have also invested quite a bit in my professional development.\"\n \nWhen he's not working, Van Lew is studying for his doctoral degree in higher education from the U of A, playing board games or reading a book - his favorite author is Anton Chekhov. He also loves to travel, citing South Korea as his favorite country to travel for food and Turkey and Russia as his favorite countries to travel to for culture.\n \n\"International education is important because it helps people learn how to think differently and handle themselves culturally,\" he said. \"A lot of people think international education is just about having more diversity, but it has real-world implications for all of us.\"\n \n\"If you spent time in another country or been around people from another country, you recognize that they think differently and that their country isn't exactly like our country,\" he added.",

NOW the Deep State has made its 27-Dimensional Chess move to cement the place of THE conspiracy in place and it will be left only to a few patriots [ with names like 'Catturd' ] and the Dilbert Guy to carry the torch of truth. Because WE knew it didn't add up because Ray Epps had never been charged and now the evil genius bastards have CHARGED RAY EPPS. He could get up to 90 days and be fined maybe $500! American!\nThe conspiracy to frame Donald Trump is the greatest conspiracy in the history of the world and it was designed to make it look like Trump lost the 2020 election and destroy Jon Voight's chances of winning a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Oscars and make Joe Rogan look stupid. Well, MORE stupid. And then when the LEAK happened — the provocateur — the FBI plant who started it all and whose fault it all is — Ray Epps talked all the Trump supporters into going into the Capitol even though the other part of the conspiracy says everybody who went INTO the Capitol was Antifa — when it was revealed by the investigative team of Maria Bartiromo and Catturd that the feds left one nearly invisible loose thread — that the Deep State claimed Ray Epps wasn't a plant yet they never CHARGED Ray Epps, they suddenly DID charge Ray Epps yesterday and the masterminds behind this vast earth-shattering conspiracy decided to cover their tracks and silence all protest forever by … charging him with one misdemeanor count of disruptive conduct and he's pleading guilty today.\nAnd yet there it is, across Right Wing Looney Tunes land, the utter conviction, the absolute certainty from each of them that they alone have noticed that Epps was charged with one negligible offense and has seemingly already made a plea deal and that the rest of the world didn't notice — everybody but Catturd, who valiantly stood up and braved assassination probably by typing, 'You're not fooling anyone, Feds!'\nOh God, are they stupid.\nAnd The Stupid was all around the circuit yesterday: somebody used Matt Gaetz's printer to produce a copy of his resolution to oust McCarthy as Speaker, then left it in a Baby-Changing Station to be found by a reporter.\n\nI'm not so sure that this was necessarily done by Gaetz. That sounds like a traditional revenge ploy (leave a false document that implicates someone).\n\nTim Scott was stupid enough to attack unions. Trump attacked Biden with the 25th Amendment and got everything ABOUT the 25th Amendment wrong. And 46 Republican Senators wrote a letter complaining about the relaxed attire rules in the Senate when the owner of their party wears bronzer, spray paints his hair, and lives inside a baseball cap.\n\nAnd I saw on Reddit that Marjorie Taylor Greene got in on the act. And then got burned.\n\nB-Block\n\n(19:30) THE WORST PERSONS IN THE WORLD: Peter Baker thinks the job of the President of the United States has actually been made tougher by something written by a guy who is evidently a columnist for the Washington Post. Add it to the list: Trump either doesn't know how the 25th Amendment work or thinks his cultists don't. And Dwayne Augustine, superintendent of the Hamshire-Fannet Independent Texas school district, fires a teacher for reading The Diary of Anne Frank a Young Girl to 8th Graders because it was too sexy.\n\nYes, a lot of people make that mistake. About the title of that book, I mean. Keith still should have caught it, though.\n\nMaus from the local library a few months ago, because it has nudity in it? What is with these conservatives? (Oh, I forgot the title of this episode there for a moment.)\n\nC-Block\n\n\n\nThat's all the damage for now. Good morning, good afternoon, good night, and good luck!",

        "summary": "summary\n\nAll Men and Both Sexes explores the use of such universal terms as \"people,\" \"man,\" or \"human\" in early modern England, from the civil war through the Enlightenment. Such language falsely implies inclusion of both men and women when actually it excludes women. Recent scholarship has focused on the Rights of Man doctrine from the Enlightenment and the French Revolution as explanation for women's exclusion from citizenship. According to Hilda Smith we need to go back further, to the English Revolution and the more grounded (but equally restricted) values tied to the \"free born Englishman.\" Citing educational treatises, advice literature to young people, guild records, popular periodicals, and parliamentary debates, she demonstrates how the \"male maturation process\" came to define the qualities attached to citizenship and responsible adulthood, which in turn became the basis for modern individualism and liberalism. By the eighteenth century a new discourse of sensibility was describing women as dependent beings outside the state, in a separate sphere and in need of protection. This excluded women from reform debates, forcing them to seek not an extension of a democratic franchise but a specific women's suffrage focused on gender difference.",

        "summary": "\"I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you, the riches of his glorious inheritance in his holy people,  and his incomparably great power for us who believe. That power is the same as the mighty strength…' -\nEphesians 1:18-19\n, NIV\nOur church began a new class on sharing your faith without fear. I shared with friends how excited I was for this class to start, and I couldn't wait to learn more. With quizzical expressions, they asked why I would need a course like this; sharing the gospel seemed like second nature for me.\nAs a believer for multiple decades, active in our church, and faith writer and speaker, people often think that evangelism is natural for me. While I have been blessed with the gift of gab and don't mind sharing my thoughts on the web or presenting to a group, one-on-one evangelism makes my heart race, my palms sweaty, and a slight rash develops on my neck.\nWhy do we often find it challenging to share the gospel with people? Many Christians have an intense faith and desire to see people be saved, yet when it comes down to having the conversation, they find it difficult. Some reasons we discussed in class were fear, rejection, not knowing what to say, and nervousness. \nYes, to all the above, I've experienced these emotions and many others. Maybe you have, too?\nHowever, recently, what's held me back is the discouragement I feel when people don't accept the message or completely shut me down. Maybe we have a good initial conversation, but it stops there. I walk away wondering what I did wrong, questioning if I could have said something differently or better, or sometimes, I hate to admit, I just stop pursuing gospel conversation altogether.\nFriend, if you've felt this way, let me encourage you. Rarely will leading someone to \nsalvation\n be a one-and-done conversation. It could be a lifetime of interactions, years of gathering together, or, at the very least, multiple conversations before someone accepts Christ. We are finite creatures; we only see what is happening on the surface. But God, he is infinite. He isn't bound by time and constantly works 'behind the scenes.' There are many times I want to see behind spiritual curtains, but I have to trust that through my obedience and faithfulness, the Lord is moving and working in people's lives. \nI say it often, but it is a truth we need to speak over ourselves and our brothers and sisters in Christ; nothing is wasted in God's economy; he uses it all to bring people to Christ and bring Himself glory. \nAfter reading Paul's words in Ephesians, I changed my prayers for the lost souls from 'please save _______' to asking the Lord to open their eyes and hearts to receive the Gospel. Only the Lord can save people, but he graciously allows us to work with Him to bring people to Christ. We are the instruments and tools the Lord uses; we can make an eternal impact, even when we can't see the results. \nGod desires that all will come to know Him (\n1 Timothy 2:4-6\n); He loved the world so much that He sent His son to die on \nthe cross\n for our sins so that we would have eternal life (\nJohn 3:16\n). While salvation is only available through accepting Jesus, Paul tells us that people can't call on the name of the Lord without hearing the Gospel. And how do they do that? With Christ's extraordinary power, ordinary Christians get to share the good news (\nRomans 10:14-15\n).\nThe next time you feel the Holy Spirit nudge you, share your testimony and ask if they know Jesus. Pray that the Holy Spirit will guide your conversation and that the Lord will soften their hearts to hear the only message worth repeating. Remember, God loves the person you share with so much that he made a way for them to have a personal relationship and salvation through Jesus Christ. \nHeavenly Father, we can't say it enough: thank you. Thank you, thank you for the gift of salvation. We pray that we will be bold in sharing the good news. Help us not to get discouraged but press on, knowing that You are always at work. We pray for unbelievers that the eyes of their hearts will be enlightened so that they can know You (\nEphesians 1:18\n). We love You. In Jesus's Name, Amen. \nPhoto Credit: ©GettyImages/Morsa Images\nLaura Bailey\n is a Bible teacher who challenges and encourages women to dive deep in the Scriptures, shift from an earthly to an eternal mindset, and filter life through the lens of God's Word.  She is the author of \nBeyond the Noise,\n and loves any opportunity to speak and teach women of all ages.

        "summary": "Is it just me or is getting a brand new phone almost as exciting as getting a new car? Maybe you don't feel that way but one thing is the same, the question of what to do with your old one.\nWhether it's a new car or a phone, you need to think about how to get the most for the old one. Is it trading it in or selling it to someone else?\nHere's what I found when I compared prices and trade-in values for the new iPhone 15.\nWhen any new phone is released, carriers and manufacturers are so eager to sell you one, that they're willing to give you something for your old phone.\nApple, for example, if you upgrade to an iPhone 15, Apple will give you a $430 trade-in value for an iPhone 14, $250 for an iPhone 12, and up to $60 for an iPhone 8.\nYou'll do better by trading in your old phone to your carrier. T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon are offering deals right now and depending on your plan, might give you considerably more than Apple. Paying for an upgraded plan at any of these carriers can give you a trade-in value almost equal to the cost of the new device.\nI did notice something interesting. The trade-in value of any phone does not take into consideration the storage. An iPhone 12 Pro with 512 GB of storage has the same trade-in value as one with 128 GB, even though you paid $200 more for it. That's kind of a raw deal and appears to be the same at Apple and all of the carriers. This is a fairly recent change so be aware if it's been a while since you traded in a phone.\nAndroid phones don't hold value as well as iPhones generally speaking, but carriers are more likely to trade a new Android device for an older one. Upgrading to the new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 is free at AT&T by trading in the Z Flip which is worth only about $35 but again, that depends on the plan you have now.\nIt's easier to go the trade-in route and best if you're upgrading to a new phone but if you want the most cash for your old device or if you're selling the one you have to purchase a not-so-new phone, it's best to sell it. On the Facebook marketplace, iPhone 12's are selling anywhere from\n \n$250 to $500, and on Gazelle the iPhone 12 pro, is worth $329. That's cash.\nSo the best deal if you're upgrading a phone is by trading it in with your carrier. And check for deals. Most of the carriers are willing to make a better offer if you're willing to switch carriers.",

        "excerpt": "Thousands of Libyans have lost family members, friends and neighbors in the devastating floods that engulfed the country's east",
        "summary": "DERNA, Libya (AP) — Abdel-Hamid al-Hassadi survived the devastating \nflooding in eastern Libya\n, but he lost some 90 people from his extended family.\n\n\nThe 23-year-old law graduate rushed upstairs along with his mother and his elder brother, as heavy rains lashed the \ncity of Derna\n on the evening of Sept. 10. Soon, torrents of water were washing away buildings next to them. \n\n\n'We witnessed the magnitude of the catastrophe,' al-Hassadi said in a phone interview, referring to the massive flooding that engulfed his city. 'We have seen our neighbors' dead bodies washing away in the floods.\"\n\n\nHeavy rains from Mediterranean storm Daniel caused the collapse of the \ntwo dams that spanned the narrow valley\n that divides the city. That sent a wall of water several meters high through its heart.\n\n\nTen days after the disaster, al-Hassadi and thousands of others remain in Derna, most of them waiting for a word about relatives and loved ones. For Hassadi, it's the 290 relatives still missing. \n\n\nThe floods inundated as much as a quarter of the city, officials say. Thousands of people were killed, with many dead bodies still under the rubble or at sea, according to search teams. Government officials and aid agencies have given varied death tolls.\n\n\nThe World Health Organization says a total of 3,958 deaths have been registered in hospitals, but a previous death toll given by the head of Libya's Red Crescent said at least 11,300 were killed. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says at least \n9,000 people are still missing\n. \n\n\nBashir Omar, a spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said the fatalities are in the thousands, but he didn't give a specific toll for the number of retrieved bodies, since there are many groups involved in the recovery effort. \n\n\nMany Derna residents, including women and children, are spending all their time at collection points of bodies. They are desperate to know who is inside body bags carried by ambulances.\n\n\nInside a school in the western part of the city, authorities posted photos of the retrieved bodies. \n\n\nAnas Aweis, a 24-year-old resident, lost two brothers and is still searching for his father and four cousins. He went to the Ummul Qura school in the Sheiha neighborhood to inspect the exhibited photos.\n\n\n'It's chaos,' he said after spending two hours waiting in lines. 'We want to know where they buried them if they died.\"\n\n\nThe floods have displaced at least 40,000 people in eastern Libya, including 30,000 in Derna, according to the U.N.'s migration agency. Many have moved to other cities across Libya, hosted by local communities or sheltered in schools. There are risks to staying, including potential infection by waterborne diseases. \n\n\nRana Ksaifi, assistant chief of mission in Libya for the U.N.'s refugee agency, said the floods have left 'unfathomable levels of destruction,' and triggered new waves of displacement in the already conflict-stricken nation.\n\n\nThe houseplants on the rooftop of Abdul Salam Anwisi's building survived the waters that reached up to his 4th-floor apartment. Anwisi's and a few other families rode out the deluge on the roof, which overlooks the Mediterranean Sea. They thought they wouldn't live to see daylight. Now, as he sifts through the water-damaged debris of his home, it's unclear what comes next. \n\n\n'God predetermined and he did what he wanted,' he said. \n\n\nOthers across the country are calling for Libya's leaders to be taken to task. \n\n\nHundreds of angry \nprotesters gathered Monday\n outside Derna's main mosque, criticizing the government's lack of preparation and response. They lashed out at the political class that controls the oil-rich nation since the ouster and killing of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi in 2011.\n\n\nThe North African country plunged into chaos after a NATO-backed uprising toppled and killed Gadhafi. For most of the past decade, Libya has been split between two rival administrations: one in the west backed by an array of lawless militias and armed groups, a second in the east, allied with the self-styled Libyan National Army, commanded by \nGen. Khalifa Hifter\n. Neither government tolerates dissent.\n\n\nDerna, as well as east and most of south Libya, is controlled by Hifter's forces. However, funds for municipalities and other government agencies are controlled by the rival government in the capital, Tripoli.\n\n\nAl-Hassadi, the law graduate, blamed local authorities for giving conflicting warnings to residents, leaving many defenseless. They asked residents to evacuate areas along the Mediterranean coast, but at the same time, they imposed a curfew, preventing people from leaving their homes.\n\n\n'It was a mistake to impose a curfew,\" he said. \n\n\nThe dams, Abu Mansour and Derna, were built by a Yugoslav construction company in the 1970s. They were meant to protect the city against heavy flooding, but years of no maintenance meant they were unable to keep the exceptional influx of water at bay. \n\n\nMany Libyans are now calling for an international investigation and supervision of aid funds.\n\n\n'All are corrupt here ... without exception,' said rights activist Tarik Lamloum. \n\n\n___\n\n\nMagdy reported from Cairo.\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe Associated Press is an American multinational nonprofit news agency headquartered in New York City.

        "summary": "Russia has turned food, energy and even children into weapons against Ukraine, Zelenskyy says at UN\nUNITED NATIONS (AP) — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is 'weaponizing' everything from food and energy to abducted children in its war against Ukraine. And he's warning other world leaders that the same could happen to them. Zelenskyy spoke Tuesday at the U.N. General Assembly's annual top-level meeting. He noted the war's effect on global food and fuel supplies and highlighted the situation of Ukrainian children who were taken from their families after Moscow's invasion. Russia hasn't yet had its turn to address the assembly.\nInside the delicate art of maintaining America's aging nuclear weapons\n \nKANSAS CITY NATIONAL SECURITY CAMPUS, Mo. (AP) — The U.S. will spend more than $750 billion over the next decade to overhaul nearly every part of its nuclear defenses and replace systems that in some cases are more than 50 years old. But until each of those programs is ready, it's up to young military troops and government technicians across the U.S. to care for the existing bombs, often through delicate maintenance performed by hand. The Associated Press was granted rare access inside military nuclear missile bases and government weapons facilities to report on how they are adjusting to meet the increasing workload.\nSpeaker McCarthy faces an almost impossible task trying to unite House GOP and fund the government\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Kevin McCarthy is trying to accomplish what at times seems impossible. The Republican speaker is working furiously to convince his colleagues to come together to pass a conservative bill to keep the federal government open. But it has little chance of actually preventing a federal shutdown. Whatever Republicans come up with in the House is expected to be rejected by the Senate where Democrats and most Republicans together want to fund the government. With time dwindling, plans for a Tuesday test vote were scrapped as negotiations resumed. Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to reach a deal. But even a popular defense bill was turned back Tuesday as conservatives press for cuts.\nWho was Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Sikh activist whose killing has divided Canada and India?\nNEW DELHI (AP) — A Sikh independence advocate who was killed two months ago in western Canada is at the center of a widening breach between the Indian and Canadian governments. The late Hardeep Singh Nijjar has been called a human rights activist by Sikh organizations. He has been called a terrorist by India's government, which he dismissed. India has denied any role in the killing, and has called allegations that Indian agents were involved absurd. Nijjar was a prominent member of a movement to create an independent Sikh homeland in India and was organizing an unofficial referendum among the Sikh diaspora. He also owned a plumbing business and was president of a Sikh temple.\nLeft behind and grieving, survivors of Libya floods call for accountability\nDERNA, Libya (AP) — Thousands of Libyans have lost family members, friends and neighbors in the devastating floods that engulfed the country's east. Many survivors are still sheltering inside the wrecked city of Derna, waiting for word that their loved ones' bodies have been found. They call for accountability and reconstruction of their city but many are doubtful an investigation by local authorities would uncover the truth. The floods were caused by heavy rains from Mediterranean storm Daniel. It overwhelmed the two dams, sending a wall of water through Derna. Thousands of people were killed, and thousands others remain missing.\n \nSaudi Arabia praises 'positive results' after Yemen's Houthi rebels visit kingdom for peace talks\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Saudi Arabia has praised the 'positive results' of negotiations with Yemen's Houthi rebels after they visited the kingdom for peace talks. However, Riyadh on Wednesday released few details on their negotiations to end the war tearing at the Arab world's poorest nation. The five days of talks represented the highest-level, public negotiations with the Houthis in the kingdom. They come as Saudi Arabia tries a renewed bid to end the yearslong coalition war it launched on Yemen. That conflict had become enmeshed in a wider regional proxy war the kingdom faced against its longtime regional rival Iran, with which it has now reached a détente earlier this year.\nIn Chile, justice eludes victims of Catholic clergy sex abuse years after the crisis exploded\nSANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — A clergy sex abuse scandal involving Chile's most notorious pedophile, the priest Fernando Karadima, shook the South American country in 2010 in a way never seen in Latin America. The case prompted a response from the Vatican, dozens of victims decided to speak about their own abuses and the percentage of people who distrust the Catholic Church has risen since then. With time, many survivors became activists and created organizations to defend children's rights, prevent abuse and support victims like themselves. While still trying to heal in a country wounded by human rights violations during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, they hope President Gabriel Boric will keep his promise to create a Truth, Justice and Reparation Commission.\nBiden's Democratic allies intensify pressure for asylum-seekers to get work permits\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — As migration to the United States from Venezuela and other countries soars, Democratic elected officials are pressing the Biden administration to quickly grant work permits for asylum-seekers while their cases wind through immigration courts. In New York City, tens of thousands of migrants have arrived over the past year. Mayor Eric Adams has increasingly sounded alarms and Gov. Kathy Hochul is floating the idea of state-issued work permits. Asylum-seekers must wait at least six months before they can get a work permit. That cannot be changed without Congress, but some Democrats say there are other steps that President Joe Biden could take.\nMexican railway operator halts trains because so many migrants are climbing aboard and getting hurt\nHUEHUETOCA, Mexico (AP) — A Mexican railway operator has announced it is suspending train runs in the northern part of the country because so many migrants are climbing aboard freight cars and getting hurt in the process. The Ferromex railway said Tuesday that it has temporarily ordered a halt to 60 trains. The company said in a statement that 'in recent days, there have been about a half-dozen regrettable cases of injuries or deaths' among migrants hopping freight cars. The company, part of Grupo Mexico, said some even hopped on moving freight cars with children 'despite the grave danger that represents.' It comes as migrants are increasingly desperate to reach the U.S. border.\nA Batman researcher said 'gay' in a talk to schoolkids. When asked to censor himself, he quit\nATLANTA (AP) — An author's clash with a Georgia school district over a brief mention of homosexuality in a presentation highlights the reach of conservatives' push for what what they call parents' rights. Author Marc Tyler Nobleman at first complied with a request not to mention that the son of Batman's co-creator was gay but then rebelled. He and LGBTQ+ advocates say the Forsyth County district in suburban Atlanta was wrong. The district says schools shouldn't engage in such discussions without parents knowing in advance. It's just one example of how schools are censoring LGBTQ+ themes even in states that don't have specific laws banning such talk.\n \nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "summary": "Confirming earlier public warnings, Kettering auto parts producer Tenneco has told the state it will close its Woodman Drive plant, ending 597 jobs.\n\nIn a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notice (WARN) letter that Ohio made public Wednesday, John Penn, Tenneco's learning and development manager, told the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services that Tenneco Automotive Operating Co. Inc. will discontinue all operations at the 2555 Woodman plant by Dec. 31, 2023.\n\n'This action is expected to be permanent in nature and affects non-union and union-represented employees. Tenneco currently employs 597 total union and non-union employees at the facility,' Penn wrote in the letter, which is dated April 11.\n\n\n\nBut while the plant will be closed by the end of 2023, layoffs will start this June, the company said.\n\nCredit: JIM NOELKER/STAFF Credit: JIM NOELKER/STAFF\n\nTenneco has been one of Kettering's largest employers, and the city has been in touch with the company since the closing was announced, City Manager Mark Schwieterman said Thursday.\n\nThe closing 'process is fluid, and Tenneco has been keeping us advised as much as possible,' he said in an email. 'Anticipated dates are offered, but nothing is ever set in stone until the company releases it to the public.'\n\nAfter November's closing announcement, the city started forming a group of local and regional agencies to put a plan in place to assist displaced workers, Schwieterman said.\n\nIt reached out to Montgomery County, Sinclair Community College, the Dayton Development Coalition and the Dayton Chamber of Commerce to 'combine expertise and resources available when Tenneco employees need it,' he said. 'Tenneco is equally concerned about its employees and has been working with us, as well.'\n\nGiven economic factors such as recent market oversaturation of shock absorber production and higher steel prices and material costs, it doesn't make business sense to continue production at the Kettering plant, a Tenneco spokesman told the Dayton Daily News last year.\n\nAll positions will be permanently eliminated in waves beginning June 12, 2022, or 14-days thereafter and continuing through Dec. 31, 2023, Tenneco told Ohio.\n\nA schedule for all job eliminations is not known at this time, Tenneco said, but the company also said it will provide each affected employee (directly or through a union representative) at least 60 days' advance notice of the separation date.\n\n'We believe there is a path for Tenneco and Apollo to keep these jobs in our community,' Carl Kennebrew, president of the IUE-CWA union that represents Tenneco workers, said in an email Thursday.\n\nApollo Funds entered into a pact to acquire Tenneco in February.\n\n'Our workforce is highly skilled and well-trained, and they have helped make this company a success,' Kennebrew said. 'Tenneco has received millions in tax subsidies, yet they are looking to move operations to Mexico and China, where the company can exploit workers with low wages. These workers and our community deserve better.'\n\nAsked if the union was talking with Tenneco about the possibility of keeping the plant open, Kennebrew said he would welcome the chance to do that.\n\nMeanwhile, the city has met with Tenneco to discuss what employees may need as the closing date draws nearer, Schwieterman said.\n\n'In conjunction with our community partners, including workforce services providers, Kettering and the region are ready to offer education, skilled trade training and job opportunities to help employees prepare and advance during their next chapter,' he added.\n\nTenneco's Kettering operations accounted for about 800 jobs in 2020, city records show. Jobs were down to about 650 when the closing was announced, officials said.\n\nYet Tenneco has remained a significant source of income tax revenues for the city. Income tax receipts account for about 79% of Kettering's general fund, the 2022 Kettering budget states.\n\nThe Tenneco site is 'a fantastic location for a number of businesses,' Schwieterman said. 'There is a need for industrial space in the Dayton market, and we are optimistic that there will be a quick turnaround.'",

        "summary": "Exports\n\nPakistan's rice exports have seen a significant decline of 17.33% during the first two months of the current fiscal year, with the nation exporting over 340,237 metric tons of rice worth approximately $233.991 million, as reported by the Bureau of Statistics. The data indicates a substantial drop when compared to the same period last year.\n\nIn the corresponding months of the previous fiscal year (July-August 2022), Pakistan had exported a total of 507,144 metric tons of rice, fetching around $283.056 million in revenue.\n\nThis decline in rice exports highlights the challenges faced by Pakistan's agriculture sector during the ongoing fiscal year, as global dynamics continue to affect trade patterns.\n\nHowever, there is a silver lining within these statistics, as the report reveals that Basmati rice exports have increased by 8.29% during the same period. This suggests that Pakistan's high-quality Basmati rice remains in demand globally, providing some relief to the country's overall export figures.\n\n\n\nApart from rice, the report also sheds light on Pakistan's performance in other food categories. During the first two months of the current fiscal year, the country earned approximately $39.338 million by exporting about 20,539 metric tons of fish and fish products.\n\nWhile the seafood sector maintained its export momentum, the overall exports of food commodities saw a modest decrease of 1.65%. Food commodities worth $711.748 million were exported, compared to $723.696 million during the same period last year.\n\nThe decline in overall food exports may be attributed to various factors, including global market fluctuations, trade restrictions, and economic uncertainties that have prevailed during this fiscal year.",

        "excerpt": "Lawyers for three Georgia Republicans, who falsely claimed that Donald Trump won the state and they were 'duly elected and qualified' electors, are set to argue that their criminal charges should be…",
        "summary": "ATLANTA (AP) — Lawyers for three Georgia Republicans, who falsely claimed that \nDonald Trump\n won the state and they were 'duly elected and qualified' electors, are set to argue Wednesday that criminal charges against them should be moved from state to federal court.\n\n\nDavid Shafer, Shawn Still and Cathy Latham were among the 18 people indicted last month along with Trump on charges they \nparticipated in a wide-ranging scheme\n to keep the Republican president in power after his 2020 \nelection loss to Democrat Joe Biden\n. All \n19 defendants\n have pleaded not guilty.\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Steve Jones is set to hear arguments Wednesday on why Shafer, Still and Latham believe the case against them should be tried in federal court rather than in Fulton County Superior Court. Jones already \nrejected a similar effort\n from Trump White House \nchief of staff Mark Meadows\n, who has appealed that ruling. He \nheld a hearing Monday\n on a similar bid by former U.S. Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and has yet to rule.\n\n\nShafer, Still and Latham have all indicated in court filings that they will not be present in court for the hearing.\n\n\nIf their cases are moved to federal court, a jury would be drawn from a broader and potentially less Democratic pool than in Fulton County alone. And any trial would not be photographed or televised, as cameras are not allowed inside federal courtrooms. But it would not open the door for Trump, if he's elected again \nin 2024\n, or another president to issue pardons because any conviction would still happen under state law.\n\n\nPart of the overarching illegal scheme, the indictment alleges, was the casting of false Electoral College votes at the Georgia Capitol on Dec. 14, 2020, and the transfer of documentation of those votes to the president of the U.S. Senate, the National Archives, the Georgia secretary of state and the chief judge of the federal court in Atlanta. Those documents were \nmeant to 'disrupt and delay'\n the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, in order to 'unlawfully change the outcome' of the election, the indictment says.\n\n\nProsecutors allege that Shafer, Still, Latham — and the other Georgia Republicans who participated in that plan — 'falsely impersonated' electors. The related charges against them include impersonating a public officer, forgery, false statements and writings, and attempting to file false documents.\n\n\nRepublicans in six other battleground states that Trump lost also met and signed fake elector certificates. Michigan's attorney general in July \nbrought criminal charges\n against the fake electors there. \n\n\nLawyers for the three contend that a legal challenge to the state's election results was pending and that lawyers told them it was necessary to have an alternate slate of Republican electors in case the challenge was successful.\n\n\nThey cite the example of the 1960 presidential election when Republican Richard Nixon was initially certified as the winner in Hawaii. Supporters of Democrat John F. Kennedy filed a legal challenge that was still pending on the day the state's presidential electors were to meet. That day, the certified electors for Nixon and uncertified elector nominees for Kennedy met at the state Capitol to cast votes for their candidates and sent them to Congress as required by the Electoral Count Act. Kennedy ultimately won the election challenge and was certified the winner, and Congress counted the votes of the Kennedy electors.\n\n\nAt the time of the actions alleged in the indictment, Shafer was the chair of the Georgia Republican Party, Latham was the chair of the Coffee County Republican Party and Still was the finance chair for the state Republican Party. Still was elected to the state Senate last year and represents a district in Atlanta's suburbs.\n\n\nTheir lawyers say their clients were acting as contingent U.S. presidential electors and in that role were or were acting at the direction of federal officers. Their actions outlined in the indictment stem directly from that service, and they were performing duties laid out in the U.S. Constitution and the Electoral Count Act, their lawyers argue. As a result, they assert defenses under several different federal laws.\n\n\nThe prosecution team led by Fulton County District Attorney \nFani Willis\n argues that they were not federal officers and were not acting at the direction of a federal official carrying out a federal function. Instead, they were impersonating genuine electors at the direction of Trump's campaign with the goal of illegally keeping him in power, they said.\n\n\nThey argued in court filings that 'contingent electors' are not presidential electors — either the contingency is met and they become presidential electors or it is not met and the losing candidate's electors have no role. Even if the Trump campaign's legal challenge to the election results had been successful, they wrote, the only solution a court could impose is a new election, not a substitution by the Republican slate of electors.\n\n\nIn addition to the charges related to the fake elector plan, Shafer is also accused of lying to investigators for the Fulton County district attorney's office. Latham is accused of participating in a \nbreach of election equipment\n in Coffee County by a computer forensics team hired by Trump allies.\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe Associated Press is an American multinational nonprofit news agency headquartered in New York City.

        "excerpt": "The U.S. will spend more than $750 billion over the next decade to overhaul nearly every part of its nuclear defenses and replace systems that in some cases are more than 50 years old",
        "summary": "KANSAS CITY NATIONAL SECURITY CAMPUS, Mo. (AP) — In an ultra-sterile room at a secure factory in Kansas City, U.S. government technicians refurbish the nation's nuclear warheads. The job is exacting: Each warhead has thousands of springs, gears and copper contacts that must work in conjunction to set off a nuclear explosion.\n\n\nEight hundred miles away in New Mexico, workers in a steel-walled vault have an equally delicate task. Wearing \nradiation monitors,\n safety goggles and seven layers of gloves, they practice shaping new warhead plutonium cores — by hand. \n\n\nAnd at nuclear weapons bases across the country, troops as young as 17 keep 50-year-old warheads working until replacements are ready. A hairline scratch on a warhead's polished black cone could send the bomb off course. \n\n\nThe Associated Press was granted rare access to key parts of the highly classified nuclear supply chain and got to watch technicians and engineers tackle the difficult job of maintaining an aging nuclear arsenal. Those workers are about to get a lot busier. The U.S. will spend more than $750 billion over the next 10 years replacing almost every component of its nuclear defenses, including new stealth bombers, submarines and ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles in the country's most ambitious nuclear weapons effort since the Manhattan Project. \n\n\nIt's been almost eight decades since a nuclear weapon has been fired in war. But military leaders warn that such peace may not last. They say the U.S. has entered an \nuneasy era of global threats\n that includes a nuclear weapons buildup by \nChina\n and Russia's repeat threats to use a nuclear bomb in Ukraine. They say that America's aged weapons need to be replaced to ensure they work.\n\n\n'What we want to do is preserve our way of life without fighting major wars,' said Marvin Adams, director of weapons programs for the Department of Energy. 'Nothing in our toolbox really works to deter aggressors unless we have that foundation of the nuclear deterrent.'\n\n\nBy treaty the U.S. maintains 1,550 active nuclear warheads, and the government plans to modernize them all. At the same time, technicians, scientists and military missile crews must ensure the older weapons keep running until the new ones are installed. \n\n\nWhich means those technicians and troops are about to become much busier. \n\n\nThe project is so ambitious that watchdogs warn that the government may not meet its goals. The program has also drawn criticism from non-proliferation advocates and experts who say the current arsenal, though timeworn, is sufficient to meet U.S. needs. Upgrading it will also be expensive, they say.\n\n\n'They are going to have extreme difficulty meeting these deadlines,' said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a non-partisan group focused on nuclear and conventional weapons control. 'And the costs are going to go up.' \n\n\nHe cautioned that the sweeping upgrades could also have the undesired effect of pushing Russia and China to improve and expand their arsenals.\n\n\nWHERE IT BEGINS\n\n\nThe core of every nuclear warhead is a hollow, globe-shaped plutonium pit made by engineers at the \nEnergy Department's lab in Los Alamos\n, New Mexico, birthplace of the atom bomb. Many of the current pits in use come from the 1970s and 80s. That can be problematic, because there's a lot about plutonium's aging process that scientists still don't understand. \n\n\nThe key radioactive atom in the plutonium pit has a half life of 24,000 years, which is the amount of time it would take roughly half of the radioactive atoms present to decay. That would suggest the weapons should be viable for years to come. But the plutonium decay is still enough to cause concern that it could affect how a pit explodes. \n\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush signed an order in the 1990s banning underground nuclear tests, and the U.S. has not detonated pits to update data on their degradation since. When the last tests were performed, they provided data on pits that were at most about two decades old. That generation of pits is now pushing past 50. \n\n\nBob Webster, deputy director of weapons at Los Alamos, said scientists have relied on computer models to determine how well such old pits might work, but 'everything we're doing is extrapolating,' he said. \n\n\nThat uncertainty has pushed the department to restart pit production. The U.S. no longer produces man-made plutonium. Instead, old plutonium is essentially refurbished into new pits. \n\n\nThis task takes place inside PF-4, a highly classified building at Los Alamos that's surrounded by layers of armed guards, heavy steel doors and \nradiation monitors\n. Inside, workers handle the plutonium inside steel glove boxes, which allow them to clean and process the plutonium without being exposed to deadly radiation. \n\n\nIn the final production steps, a lone employee in the vault takes the almost-completed pit into both of her gloved hands and shapes it into its final form. \n\n\n'Things have to fit a certain way, and everything is by touch, by feel,' said the Los Alamos employee, who the AP has agreed not to name because she is one of only a handful of people in the U.S., and the only female, who performs this sensitive task. \n\n\nFor about the last 10 years technicians have been practicing on 'test' pits that aren't ready for the stockpile. The U.S. is planning to fully recycle its first weapon-ready pit next year — and quickly increase annual production to as many as 80 new pits.\n\n\nThe painstaking and hazardous work has led a government watchdog to express doubts about whether the U.S. government can meet that goal.\n\n\n'The United States has not regularly manufactured plutonium pits since 1989,' the Government Accountability Office noted in a January 2023 report, adding that the Energy Department's National Nuclear Security Administration has provided 'limited assurance that it would be able to produce sufficient numbers of pits.' \n\n\nWebster has been at Los Alamos since Ronald Reagan was president. He could have retired years ago, but has remained to shepherd the first new plutonium pits through to production. The lab is starting to feel a bit like it did in the 1980s, during the Cold War, he said. Los Alamos scientists are having intense discussions about weapon design — how much each can weigh, its explosive punch, how far it must travel. \n\n\n'We need our nation to be back making pits,' Webster said. 'We just have to be able to do that.'\n\n\nTHE WARHEAD AND THE WRISTWATCH\n\n\nCompleted pits are protected and detonated by an outer warhead layer that is built at the Energy Department's Kansas City National Security Campus. Inside that three-story windowless factory, workers restore and test those warhead parts, work that a \ngovernment watchdog\n said required 'a great deal of precision manufacturing to exacting specifications.' \n\n\nThere are thousands of tiny parts inside each warhead, so steady hands are key. That's why technicians go through a skills assessment that includes disassembling and assembling a mechanical wristwatch. \n\n\n'Everything is done under a microscope with tweezers,' said Molly Hadfield, a spokeswoman for the Kansas City plant. 'And its pass (or) fail. Either the watch works or it doesn't work.'\n\n\nThis factory would be busy even if an overhaul wasn't underway. All warheads have regular maintenance requirements. Their plastics age, and metal gears and wiring are weakened by the years and by exposure to radiation. \n\n\nThe factory is also working on warheads for the \nB-21 Raider,\n a futuristic stealth bomber, while also supporting the Sentinel, a new intercontinental ballistic missile and on warheads for a new class of submarines. \n\n\n'There's a huge modernization effort going on,' said Eric Wollerman, who manages the Kansas City complex for the Department of Energy through its federal contract with Honeywell. '​​If you're going to update the delivery systems, you would also then update the warheads in the missiles and the bombs that are with them.' \n\n\nTo meet the demand for both maintenance and modernization, the facilities have gone on a hiring spree. The Kansas City plant has 6,700 employees, a 40% jump since 2018, with plans to add several hundred more. The Los Alamos lab has added more than 4,000 employees in that same time frame.\n\n\nOLD MISSILES, YOUNG TROOPS \n\n\nThe U.S. nuclear arsenal reveals its age each time troops fix a missile. That can occur as often as twice a week, but only if the equally old tools, or the truck carrying the tools, or the truck needed to transport the missile itself isn't also broken down, which is often. \n\n\nThat is why Airman 1st Class Jonathan Marrs was dragging a second 225-pound aluminum tow behind him toward a concrete silo in the midst of vast Montana farmland on a recent hot afternoon. \n\n\nMarrs, 21, and other airmen used a tow and wrenches the size of human femurs to dislodge silo Bravo-9's 110-ton blast door. Underneath its cement and steel cover was a 70,000-pound nuclear missile; the missile's warhead tip needed to be lifted out and trucked to base for work. \n\n\nExcept the blast door wouldn't budge. The first 225-pound tow, or mule, as the troops call it, couldn't generate the power needed to pull back the door. \n\n\nAfter attaching a second mule, Marrs and the other airman succeeded in pulling the door free, releasing scores of mice. \n\n\nThe maintainers next unfastened the warhead from the missile and placed it in a specialized truck. It's then escorted by Air Force security forces back to a heavily guarded hangar at \nMontana's Malmstrom Air Force Base\n.\n\n\nMarrs and the other young airmen — known as maintainers — are closely monitored as they handle nuclear weapons, U.S. Air Force officials said.\n\n\n'If I under-inflate a basketball at the gym, no one will care,' said Chief Master Sgt. Andrew Zahm, the maintenance group senior enlisted leader at F.E. Warren Air Force Base. 'If I did something with one of these weapons, the president would know about it in 45 minutes.' \n\n\nThe workload is already a challenge for these troops, and there aren't many easy ways to relieve it. \n\n\nWhile the private-sector managed Los Alamos and Kansas City plants have hired personnel to meet the rising workload, the military has struggled to fill jobs and retain experienced technicians. Instead, the military must do more with fewer maintainers, and for much less money than those troops could make as government contractors. \n\n\n'Once you start showing a staff sergeant the $80,000\" they could make in the private sector, they are going to take it, Zahm said. \n\n\nZahm is a rarity. While many have retired or left for private industry, he's remained to keep serving the military's nuclear mission. With the U.S. so close to its first new weapon, he's driven by a desire to see it through. 'In 21 years I've never seen a new thing,' Zahm said. 'I want to see the new stuff.' \n\n\n___\n\n\nCopp reported from Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico; the Kansas City National Security Campus, Missouri; Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana and F.E.

        "summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Facing fresh challenges to his leadership, Speaker Kevin McCarthy is trying to accomplish what at times seems impossible — working furiously to convince House Republicans to come together and pass a conservative bill to keep the federal government open.\n\nIt's a nearly futile exercise that could help McCarthy keep his job, but has little chance of actually preventing a federal shutdown. Whatever House Republicans come up with is nearly certain to be rejected by the Senate, where Democrats and most Republicans want to fund the government.\n\nIn one dramatic sign of defeat Tuesday, House Republicans were even voting against their own defense bill. During a rowdy afternoon vote, the usually popular bill was turned back from consideration, 212-214, after five hard-right conservatives helped sink it. They want to see an overall plan from McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy simply walked off the House floor. 'Look, the one thing you're going to learn about me: I like a challenge — I don't like this big a challenge — but we're just gonna keep doing it until we can make it,' McCarthy told reporters.\n\nWith time dwindling, Congress faces a Sept. 30 deadline to pass the broader government funding legislation and get a bill to President Joe Biden's desk to become law. Otherwise, the U.S. faces massive federal government closures and disruptions. Plans for another vote Tuesday to advance the overall spending bill were shelved.\n\n'The ball's in Kevin's court,' said Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe latest House government funding proposal, a compromise between members of the hard-right Freedom Caucus and the more pragmatic Main Street conservatives, was almost dead on arrival, left sputtering even after McCarthy loaded it up with spending cuts and Republican priorities in a border security package.\n\nBehind closed doors Tuesday, the speaker was trying to stress the political repercussions of a government shutdown to Republicans, warning them that no party wins with a closure.\n\nUnlike last week when an angry and frustrated McCarthy unleashed foul language on his colleagues, he tried a different tack when addressing his members privately in the Capitol basement.\n\nAppearing cool, calm and collected, McCarthy cast the funding plan as just a proposal and left time for rank-and-file members to debate, according to Republicans familiar with the meeting.\n\nStill, one Republican after another rose to tell McCarthy that the current plan would not have their votes. With a slim majority, he needs almost every Republican on board.\n\nRep. Stephanie Bice, R-Okla., one of the negotiators for the Main Street group, urged her colleagues later to not let the 'perfect be the enemy of the good.'\n\nThe showdown over the usually popular defense bill shows the difficulty ahead — it was the second time McCarthy had tried to advance the measure after he abruptly withdrew it from consideration last week.\n\nThe attempt to soothe tensions among Republicans comes as tempers are flaring and as big personalities try to seize the upper hand — some trying to lead and others hoping to disrupt any plans for compromise.\n\nFlorida's two leading conservatives, Matt Gaetz and newcomer Byron Donalds, are sniping in the halls and across social media, as Gaetz criticizes the deal Donalds and others struck as insufficiently conservative.\n\nAnd freshmen Rep. Victoria Spartz, R-Ind., pointedly attacked McCarthy as a 'weak speaker.'\n\nOne seasoned lawmaker Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., warned the infighting could derail the House GOP, much the way it did for past speakers like John Boehner and Paul Ryan. Both retired earlier than expected amid constant threats of ousters.\n\nWomack said he fears there is a 'larger fight' brewing 'that is more of a personality nature because of the conflict between certain members and the speaker.'\n\nThe monthlong funding package that McCarthy is pushing would impose steep spending cuts of more than 8% on many government services, while sparing defense and veterans accounts. It would last for 31 days in hopes of giving House Republicans time to approve the more traditional government funding bills.\n\nThe White House issued a memo detailing cuts from the Republican plan, saying it would mean fewer border patrol agents, school teachers and aides, Meals on Wheels for seniors and Head Start slots for children, among other cutbacks.\n\n'Extreme House Republicans are playing partisan games with peoples' lives and marching our country toward a government shutdown,' the White House said.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of the steep cuts Republicans are planning with their 'cruel' and 'reckless' spending plan.\n\nAt its core, House Republicans are trying to undo the deal McCarthy reached with Biden earlier this year to set federal funding levels as part of the debt ceiling fight. Conservatives rejected that measure then, even though it was approved and signed into law, and they are trying to dismantle it now.\n\nBut House Republicans are late to the effort, with time running short to act. Whatever bills they pass are certain to run aground in the Senate, where bipartisan groups of senators have already started approving their own funding bills, some at levels higher than the Biden-McCarthy agreement.\n\nThe roughly dozen Republicans who have voiced displeasure at McCarthy's proposal see the current impasse as a make-or-break moment to hold the speaker to commitments to drastically cut topline government spending.\n\n'If my party is not going to stand up, what is the right thing to do?' said Spartz. 'No matter how hard, I don't think anyone else will.'\n\nWhen Spartz was asked whether she would support an effort to oust McCarthy, she said she was 'open to everything.'\n\nBut Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, who helped draft the proposal, all but dared his fellow Freedom Caucus members and other 'so-called conservative colleagues' to reject it — particularly its 'dream bill' provisions for dealing with the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\n'If my conservative colleagues want to vote against that, go explain that,' Roy said.\n\nThe holdouts want steeper cuts that would adhere to the $1.47 trillion for annual discretionary funding they had initially advanced earlier this year to raise the nation's debt limit.\n\nAnother seasoned lawmaker, Republican Rep. Mike Simpson of Idaho, warned of pain ahead for Americans if the government shuts down.\n\n'It would be disastrous,' he said. 'I've never seen a time when a shutdown is good policy or good politics.'\n\nSimpson suggested it was time for McCarthy to reach out to Democrats to strike a bipartisan deal.\n\nBut that would almost certainly lead McCarthy's right-flank to try to hold a vote to oust him from the speaker's job.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Josh Boak contributed to this report.",

        "summary": "Recently released data from the Environmental Protection Agency shows that 19 counties in 11 states, including seven from North Dakota, recorded air quality levels in the purple or 'very unhealthy' range for a full 24-hour period for the first time this year.\n\nThe hazardous conditions have been attributed to widespread wildfires north of the border in Canada, which caused a massive plume of noxious smoke to slowly creep across the upper Midwest this summer.\n\nWhen the resulting plume of smoke first descended upon the Peace Garden State in mid-May, North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality manager Ryan Mills said the data spat out by the state's environmental quality system were hitting numbers he had never seen before.\n\n'On any given day in North Dakota, if you take industry out of the equation, we have great air quality. It's some of the cleanest in the nation.' Mills said, 'I looked at those numbers and said, ‘That can't be right.' '\n\nMills and his team double checked their numbers and then reached out to park rangers to see if there was any local burning going on that they didn't know about. The rangers responded that the smoke was so thick they could barely see anything past their noses. Mills said that such air conditions have become more common in recent years as the Great White North serves as a tinderbox for conflagrations often beyond the control of Canadian authorities.\n\n'Fires started kicking up in Canada there on May 17th to the 18th. It was the worst air quality this state has ever seen.' Mills said, 'The only time we have issues is with wildfires – when things are outside of our control.'\n\nMills said the air conditions were not limited to Ward, Burke, Billings, Dunn, Mercer, Oliver and Burleigh Counties, as the smoke blanketed the entire state. Not every community in the state is able to record EPA air quality data, while the eight counties are home to monitoring stations and sensors which track air quality on the Bakken oil field, which he said is why they've been singled out in the data. Even then, most 'Purple monitor' readings aren't always the most reliable as they are recorded by municipalities and citizens rather than stable agencies like the EPA.\n\n'The caution is that they are not regulatory. They're more like a smoke detector. They'll tell you there is a fire, but they don't tell you how bad it actually is.' Mills said, 'Another concern is the condition of the sensors. Typically, we only have to maintain or clean our sensors once a quarter. Now it's something we have to do every trip. It's been daunting.'\n\nAn aspect of the Canadian fires that differ from a prairie fire is the density of the trees and overgrowth, which can sometime reach as high as 30 feet. With all that extra fuel and heat, the smoke plume is lifted higher into the atmosphere, allowing it to be as well traveled as it has been this year. According to Mills, more than 90 million metric tons of carbon have been released into the atmosphere by the fires, which have burned 380,000 acres in Canada this summer alone.\n\n'I know people are wondering ‘Is this ever going to end?' That plume from May has traveled across the country and the Pacific Ocean all the way to Western Europe. The smoke has even reached the North Pole.' Mills said, 'I get it, people are frustrated, but it's beyond our control. There's another front coming in, and cold fronts and other conditions bring them down to the ground.'\n\nWhile Americans may be hoping for a respite with the end of summer, Mills said that a representative from the Canadian Forest Service expects the fires to continue burning, 'until the snow flies.'",

        "summary": "National News\n \n \nSep 20, 2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe United Auto Workers union is stepping up pressure on Detroit's Big Three by threatening to expand its strike unless it sees major progress in contract negotiations by Friday.\n\n\nIn a video statement late Monday, UAW President Shawn Fain said workers at more factories will join those who are now in the fifth day of a strike at three plants.\n\n\n'We're not going to keep waiting around forever while they drag this out … and we're not messing around,'\n Fain said in announcing the noon Eastern time Friday deadline for escalating the strike unless there is \n'serious progress'\n in the talks. The union plans to disclose the locations of new strikes during an online presentation to members Friday morning.\n\n\nFord, General Motors and Stellantis said they want to settle the strike, and they held back from directly criticizing the escalation threat.\n\n\nMark Stewart, the North American chief operating officer of Stellantis, the successor to Fiat Chrysler, said the company is still looking for common ground with the UAW.\n\n\n'I hope that we're able to do that by Friday,'\n Stewart said on CNBC.\n\n\nGM said in a statement, \n'We're continuing to bargain in good faith with the union to reach an agreement as quickly as possible for the benefit of our team members, customers, suppliers and communities across the U.S.'\n\n\nA Ford spokeswoman said Tuesday that negotiations were continuing, but provided no additional details.\n\n\nIn Washington, the Biden administration reversed a plan to send acting Labor Secretary Julie Su and senior adviser Gene Sperling to Detroit this week to meet with both sides, according to a White House official. Last week, President Joe Biden publicly backed the UAW and said the officials could play a positive role.\n\n\nThe White House now believes that since negotiations are taking place, \n'it is most productive for Sperling and Su to continue their discussions from Washington and allow talks to move forward,'\n said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private plans.\n\n\nFain had discounted the need for help from Washington, saying \n'This battle is not about the president,'\n and some Democrats opposed the White House involvement.\n\n\n'I do not believe that the president himself should intervene as he did in the railroad strike in these talks. He should not be at that table,'\n said Rep. Debbie Dingell, whose congressional district includes part of southeast Michigan.\n\n\nSo far the strike is limited to about 13,000 workers at a Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan, a GM factory in Wentzville, Missouri, and a Stellantis plant in Toledo, Ohio.\n\n\nHowever, layoffs are starting to occur at other locations as the strike crimps the industry's supply chain.\n\n\nIn Toledo, 12 different shops that supply the Jeep plant where UAW is striking have laid off more than 1,600 workers, according to Bruce Baumhower, president of the union local in northeast Ohio. More than half will get state unemployment benefits, while workers at two companies located inside the Jeep plant have been approved for payments from the union strike fund, \n'but they can't picket because they're not on strike,'\n he said.\n\n\nGM warned Monday that the strike in Wentzville, near St. Louis, could force the company to idle an assembly plant in Kansas City early this week. On Tuesday, the company said that it expected to keep production going in Kansas City for at least one more day.\n\n\nThe automakers normally provide supplemental or partial pay to workers who are idled because of supply chain problems, but Ford and GM have said they will not do that this time because the shutdowns are caused by a strike. The union argues that layoffs are a choice by management, but the union's ability to challenge the change in policy is unclear.\n \n \nToday's breaking news and more in your inbox",

        "summary": "Home Daily News Convicted Milberg Partners Accused in Lawsuit…\n\nLaw Firms\n\nConvicted Milberg Partners Accused in Lawsuit of Draining Firm's Assets\n\nTwo former partners at Milberg contend in a lawsuit that partners who pleaded guilty to paying kickbacks to lead plaintiffs harmed the law firm and drained its assets.\n\nThe suit could be just the beginning of litigation against founder Melvyn Weiss and former partners William Lerach, Douglas Bershad and Steven Schulman, the New York Law Journal reports. Sanford Dumain, a member of Milberg's management committee, told the publication the firm is also considering litigation against the former leaders.\n\nOn Monday, Milberg agreed to pay a $75 million fine in exchange for an agreement with prosecutors to drop charges against the firm filed in connection with the kickbacks.\n\nThe suit was filed in Manhattan federal court by former antitrust partners Michael Buchman and John Richards. Buchman's suit names all four former partners as defendants; Richards' suit does not name Bershad.\n\nThe plaintiffs said judges disqualified them in two cases because of the law firm's legal troubles, the New York Law Journal story says. Their complaints claim the defendants refused to quickly acknowledge the truth, putting the professional and financial interests of other lawyers at the firm in jeopardy.\n\nA lawyer for Weiss, Benjamin Brafman, responded to an inquiry from the New York Sun about Richards' case, saying it is without merit. 'Instead of seeking to take unfair advantage of a difficult situation, Mr. Richards should take note of the extraordinary success he was able to enjoy and participate in, largely as a result of the genius and great legal skills of Mel Weiss,' he wrote in an e-mail to the publication.",

This expansion represents the first implementation in Europe of T5's world-class solutions to ensure customers maintain a Forever On environment, while minimizing impact on the climate.\n\nThese programs are underscored by T5's commitment to excellence and its demonstrated track record of continuous uptime for customers. With the successful implementation of facilities management in Denmark, T5 will expand availability of its services to the broader European market.\n\nIn addition to the facilities management solutions T5 offers, the company is focusing on its lifecycle services.\n\nThe T5 Lifecycle Data Center Services Platform is built on a foundational belief that meaningful and lasting data center services require insights beyond traditional location, space and power. An efficient and financially focused data center strategy requires a partner with the experience and ability to support ongoing business goals, not only building or operating a facility.\n\nThe modern data center has been around since the early 1990s, but in some ways the industry is just beginning. There are several market forces at play that are pushing its evolution.\n\nFirst, there's the explosion of data volume, which presents significant challenges, as data centers will be under more stress to handle the sheer amount of information being generated.\n\nSecond, beyond the massive amounts of data being generated, there is the type of data and the way it is being used.\n\nDevices and services are increasingly powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), both of which have higher, more complex requirements. The growing demand to keep up with data is about processing as much as it is about storage.",

He first came to our attention about four years ago when he voiced an anti-democratic resolution by Alabama Republicans to petition Congress to expel Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, citing several Islamophobic conspiracy theories about her as the justification, and claiming they were in violation of Article I of the Constitution and that she was 'disloyal to the United States'.\nCongresswoman Omar, for her part, replied that the timing of claiming she was an improper candidate was ironic, because the Alabama GOP had just decided outright bigot and alleged pedophile Roy Moore was their nominee for U.S. Senate within the same calendar year.\nIn 2021, during the Covid-19 pandemic, Hanes sponsored an extremely counter-productive bill that was aimed at letting employees sue their employers over 'Covid-19 side-effects' if they were mandated to take vaccines as a condition of employmentAh, anti-vaxx policy. A modern conservative staple.\nBut back to conspiracy theories… in 2021, Tommy Hanes got on his Facebook, and claimed the ' Chinese Communist Party has infiltrated Alabama Academia ', which, if there's one place that's coveted for its academia, it's ALABAMA, right?\nHanes' voting record for eight years is exactly what you'd expect, with anti-LGBTQ, pro-gun, anti-choice, theocratic nitwits… Like, he was terrified of kids in schools practicing yoga.\nTommy Hanes was booted from office in the 2022 GOP Primary for his seat, where he was defeated by 245 votes. In a pattern that many Republicans have adapted, he was banging the drums about 'voter fraud' and was trying to get voting machines replaced with paper ballots only six days before the primary. Almost like he wanted to change the rules, because he knew if they held, he'd be a loser.\nAnd so he is.",

        "summary": "SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Governors from the Southwestern United States are pursuing stronger business ties with Taiwan in hopes of attracting new foreign investments and jobs to their landlocked states. \n\n\nTrade missions this week have taken New Mexico. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and Arizona counterpart Katie Hobbs, both Democrats, to the self-governing island of Taiwan.\n\n\nHobbs said her goal was to encourage ongoing investments to make Arizona a hub for semiconductor manufacturing. She met Monday with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. executives and suppliers, visiting their plant as well as water treatment facilities. \n\n\nArizona leaders have been touting that the state will be the home of a Taiwanese microchip manufacturer's first U.S. plant, generating 12,000 construction jobs. \n\n\nConstruction started in 2021 on that sprawling facility that will utilize precision trademark technology for semiconductor fabrication with the capacity to produce 20,000 wafers per month. Once completed and operational next year, the plant is estimated to create 4,500 high-tech jobs.\n\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden \nvisited the site in December\n, praising it as a demonstration of how his policies are fostering job growth. Biden has staked his legacy in large part on \nmajor investments in technology and infrastructure\n that were approved by Congress along bipartisan lines.\n\n\nAt a business conference in Taipei on Tuesday, Lujan Grisham urged entrepreneurs and leaders to consider investment opportunities in her home state, touting a workforce with access to subsidized child care and tuition-free college.\n\n\nLujan Grisham says she hopes to expand the presence in New Mexico of Taiwanese companies that already including the label printing business Cymmetrik and wire manufacturer Admiral Cable – both with facilities at Santa Teresa, New Mexico, near a port of entry for freight between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\n\n'Strengthening our relationships here is good for New Mexico, good for America, and good for Taiwan as we develop a global economy with a more stable and resilient supply chain,\" Lujan Grisham said in a statement.\n\n\nBeijing wants to reunite the mainland with the self-governing island of Taiwan, a goal that raises the prospect of armed conflict.\n\n\nAt the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden described U.S. partnerships around the globe aimed at creating economic, security and other advancements, even as he stressed that those relationships were not about 'containing any country' — a clear reference to Beijing.\n\n\nSeveral other governors — Democratic and Republican — have recently traveled on trade missions to Taiwan. Democrat Gretchen Whitmer became the first serving governor of Michigan to visit Taiwan, during an investments-related tour this month that included stops in Japan. Republican Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb traveled to Taiwan in August on a separate trade mission.\n\n\nIn August, Singapore-based Maxeon Solar Technologies announced plans to build a major solar panel manufacturing plant in Albuquerque, New Mexico, pending approval of a loan application with the U.S. Department of Energy. \n\n\nThe factory would employ about 1,800 people to provide photovoltaic solar panels for use in residential, commercial and utility-scale solar arrays.\n\n\nHobbs' trade mission includes a visit to South Korea.\n\n\n___\n\n\nTang reported from Phoenix.\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe Associated Press is an American multinational nonprofit news agency headquartered in New York City.

        "summary": "Australia expressed concern over Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations against the Indian government, emphasising that it is consistently monitoring developments relating to the row over Khalistani leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar's death in Surrey. \n \nSpeaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York, Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said: \"These are concerning reports. I note that investigations are still underway, but these are concerning reports. As I have said, we are monitoring these developments closely with our partners and we will continue to do so,\" as per a \nstatement\n.\n \nTrudeau sparks row over Khalistani leader's death\n \nWong's remarks come amid Nijjar's death and the subsequent deterioration of ties between New Delhi and Ottawa. Earlier this week, Trudeau accused India of orchestrating the Sikh leader's killing during an address in the Canadian Parliament. The statement, which came without any proof, was dismissed by India's Ministry of External Affairs as \"absurd\" and \"motivated.\" \n \nSince the PM's contentious comments, several world leaders have chimed in. Adrienne Watson, a spokesperson for the US National Security Council, revealed that the White House is \"deeply concerned\" about the accusations. On Tuesday, British  Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said that the UK government is in close contact with Canada over the allegations. \n \nIn the midst of this, Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly announced that a top Indian envoy was ousted from service. Striking back at this, India expelled a Canadian diplomat and instructed him to leave the country in five days. However, Trudeau seems to have backtracked within days of enduring foreign pressure.\n \n\"We are not looking to provoke or escalate, we want to work with the government of India to lay everything clear and to ensure there are proper processes\" he said in a news briefing on Tuesday in what appears to be a sharp U-turn of the claims he made earlier after Nijjar was shot dead near a gurdwara in British Columbia in June.",

        "summary": "RALEIGH, N.C.. (AP) — North Carolina Republican legislative leaders ditched late Tuesday efforts this year to dramatically multiply legal gambling in the state, announcing instead that they will pass a final budget without it that also would trigger Medicaid coverage to begin for hundreds of thousands of adults.\n\n'We think this is the best, most prudent way for us to move forward,' Senate leader Phil Berger told reporters.\n\nHouse and Senate GOP lawmakers had been grappling with how to get the votes necessary to enact language to authorize four new casinos and legitimize and regulate video gambling machines. A significant group of conservatives in the state House balked earlier this month at the idea from Senate Republicans to insert those provisions into the two-year spending plan.\n\nThen in recent days, there was talk of putting the gambling items in a bill separate from the budget and also require its passage for Medicaid expansion to finally occur. But that threatened a landmark health care deal that Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper had reached six months ago with GOP legislators, who had until recently been set against accepting expansion through the 2010 federal health care law.\n\nNearly all of Cooper's Democratic allies in the legislature wouldn't go along with the ploy, which along with Republican holdouts threatened to take down the bill.\n\nAt a hastily arranged Legislative Building news conference, Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore said that efforts to advance these types of gambling were over for the immediate future.\n\nWithin the House Republican caucus, 'clearly there were differences of opinion and at the end of the day we felt like this issue and no one single issue should hold up the budget,' Moore said.\n\nExpansion is considered a top priority of Cooper and his legislative allies. Those lawmakers opposed the effort to link it with gambling, saying it broke the promise Republicans essentially made within an expansion law that Cooper signed in March that stated enacting a budget law was required for expansion to start. And enough Republicans were still unhappy with the gambling efforts contained within to threaten to sink the measure.\n\nNow, 'Medicaid expansion will still be contingent on the budget becoming law,' Berger said.\n\nDemocrats and Christian conservatives celebrated their victory.\n\n'For the last few days, House and Senate Dems have stood united against casinos and for Medicaid expansion,' Sen. Jay Chaudhuri, a Wake County Democrat, wrote in a social media post. 'Today, we showed the state why Dems still matter.'\n\nAnd John Rustin with the North Carolina Family Policy Council praised legislators 'who stood their ground, under extreme pressure, to protect our state from the ravages of gambling, gambling addiction, and the predatory gambling industry.'\n\nMoore and Berger said details of the final two-year spending plan would now be released Wednesday, with floor votes Thursday and Friday. They both anticipated full Republican support for the budget bill, with Moore anticipating Democratic votes as well.\n\nRepublicans hold narrow veto-proof majorities in both chambers. The final budget, however, will carry many right-leaning provisions that Cooper and many Democrats will find difficult to swallow.\n\nA state budget was supposed to be in place when the new fiscal year began July 1, but negotiations slowed during the summer over the extent of income tax rate reductions and how to distribute billions of dollars for initiatives and programs.\n\nNorth Carolina already has three casinos operated by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and the Catawba Indian Nation. The gambling proposal would have created 'rural tourism districts' where gambling venues and other development could have occurred.\n\nWhile legislators have said three casinos could have been built in Anson, Nash and Rockingham counties, the language allowed other options. A fourth could have been operated by the Lumbee tribe.\n\nDevelopers would have agreed at each location to generate at least 1,750 jobs and $500 million in private investment. Operators of video gambling machines envisioned in the proposal as being legalized statewide would have been licensed by the state lottery commission.\n\nFiscal analyses by General Assembly staff estimated the state coffers would have benefitted by several hundred million dollars annually.\n\nBerger, who is from Rockingham County, has been among the most consistent and vocal supporters of the rural casino districts, citing the success of a casino in nearby Danville, Virginia.\n\nDuring Tuesday's news conference, Berger said people who talk up the need to improve rural economies opposed an effort that would have created over 5,000 good-paying jobs and increased local tax bases.\n\n'It was just pretty clear that the facts were almost beside the point as to what those proposals would do for rural areas,' Berger said, adding that emotions had overtaken discussions. 'I've learned that in an environment like that, you're unlikely to make any progress.'",

        "summary": "PITTSBURGH (AP) — It all looked so easy for Kenny Pickett and the rest of the Pittsburgh Steelers offense in August.\n\nThe heaves downfield to George Pickens. The gaping holes that created wide running lanes for Najee Harris and Jaylen Warren. The clean pocket that gave Pickett all the time he needed to do whatever he wanted.\n\nIt's all vanished in September, lost amid a flurry of three-and-outs, missed passes and missed opportunities.\n\nPittsburgh's defense has as many touchdowns as its offense through two games, both of them coming in Monday night's 26-22 victory over Cleveland, the last on T.J. Watt's scoop-and-score midway through the fourth quarter that allowed the Steelers to even their record at 1-1.\n\nWhile Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin vowed to never apologize for winning, he's well aware his team has a long way to go after managing just nine first downs against the Browns.\n\n'We have to get our mojo back,' Tomlin said. 'We've got to get that mojo that we had in the preseason where we were playing fast and fluid with confidence individually and collectively. We've lost that.'\n\nTomlin made no attempt to hide the optimism he felt heading into 2023, saying during the offseason he expected Pickett to 'kill it' as he entered his first full year as an NFL starter.\n\nTwo games in, the swagger Pickett exuded over the summer has been replaced by indecision and occasionally shaky throws. Pickett is 27th in the league in completion percentage and 29th in quarterback rating through eight very inconsistent quarters.\n\nYet the most pressing issue facing the Steelers isn't Pickett's very visible growing pains, but embattled offensive coordinator Matt Canada's game-planning.\n\nThe Steelers needed five possessions to earn a single first down in Week 1 against the 49ers. It took them four to move the chains even once against the Browns. While execution and a lack of push by the offensive line is a problem, so is the script Canada is putting together.\n\nWhile Tomlin didn't single out Canada, saying the entire coaching staff needs to do a better job, it also isn't difficult to read between the lines.\n\n'We have to anticipate schematics of those that we play against a little bit better,' Tomlin said.\n\nTranslation: it's the X's and the O's in addition to the Jimmys and the Joes.\n\nWHAT'S WORKING\n\nPaying your edge rushers what they're worth.\n\nThe Steelers briefly made Watt the highest-paid defender in NFL history two summers ago and reached into their wallet again in July to keep Alex Highsmith in the fold through at least 2027.\n\nIt certainly looks like money well spent.\n\nFor all of Pittsburgh's defensive issues — particularly against the run with defensive tackle Cam Heyward on injured reserve — Watt and Highsmith's playmaking can shift a game's trajectory in a flash, giving the Steelers chances to win games such as the one they had against Cleveland.\n\nWHAT'S NOT\n\nHeyward's absence put the onus on the secondary to help stop the run.\n\nIt hasn't happened. The Steelers have given up a league-worst 386 yards rushing through two games.\n\nSafety Damontae Kazee let Christian McCaffrey slip through his grasp in the opener, letting the 49ers star race 65 yards for a score.\n\nCornerback Levi Wallace lost contain on Cleveland's Jerome Ford early in the third quarter, with Ford sprinting 69 yards to set up a short touchdown run.\n\n\n\nTomlin was openly critical of punter Pressley Harvin III after a shaky performance in the opener against San Francisco. The team even brought back former punter Brad Wing for a look in the middle of last week.\n\nHarvin's job is probably safe — for now anyway — after pinning the Browns back inside their 20 four times on Monday, including one that landed at the Cleveland 2 then bounced to the right and went out of bounds just outside the goal line.\n\nSTOCK DOWN\n\nIt's difficult to discern whether the issue with Harris' failure to get going — he has 74 yards rushing through two games — is his fault or Canada's. Several of Harris' 10 carries against the Browns were wide tosses that asked the 232-pound Harris to try to beat smaller, quicker defenders to the corner.\n\nHarris is averaging a healthy 4.6 yards per carry, a number that is skewed by runs of 21 and 24 yards. Take those two out, and Harris is averaging just 2.1 yards per attempt, one of the reasons the Steelers have found themselves in so many third-and-longs over the first two weeks.\n\nINJURIES\n\nSafety Minkah Fitzpatrick spent a portion of early Tuesday morning at the hospital as a precaution while dealing with a chest injury.\n\nThe three-time All-Pro was back at the team's facility by Tuesday afternoon, but his availability for Sunday's visit to Las Vegas is uncertain.\n\nWide receiver Gunner Olszewski entered the concussion protocol in the second quarter after getting drilled while fumbling away a pass from Pickett.\n\nInside linebacker Elandon Roberts went down with a stinger and did not return.\n\nKEY NUMBER\n\n2 — the number of teams since 1991 that have won games they trailed in the fourth quarter despite having negative yardage over the final 15 minutes. The Steelers had minus-7 yards in the fourth quarter on Monday night.\n\n\n\nFly across the country for a Sunday night primetime visit to Las Vegas (1-1). The Steelers haven't beaten the Raiders on the road since 1995, three years before Pickett was born.\n\n___\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

        "summary": "TOKYO, Sept 20, 2023 - (JCN Newswire) - On September 15th (Friday) and 16th (Saturday), Lexus hosted the LEXUS SHOWCASE event for global media, where they shared insights into the diversification and electrification efforts of the Lexus brand. Lexus International President, Takashi Watanabe, introduced Lexus' new model lineup that meets the diversified needs of customers and regions across the world. Additionally, he discussed the future direction of Lexus' vehicle manufacturing as well as efforts to take on the challenge of developing and promoting battery EVs to achieve a carbon-neutral society.\n\nLexus International President Takashi Watanabe x Lexus LM (Prototype) / Lexus LBX (Prototype) / Lexus GX (Prototype)\n\nThe LEXUS SHOWCASE presented a new model lineup that world premiered in other regions in the first of half of 2023, together for the first time in Japan. In addition, Lexus announced the start of a customer experience program*1 for the ROV Concept*2 which is equipped with a hydrogen engine. This program aims to deliver an experience where customers feel connected to the harmony of nature, maintain the joy of driving while remaining environmentally friendly, and experience a driving sensation that only engine-powered vehicles can offer. Lexus also announced the direction of future vehicle development through electrification technology, which is currently under development, with the goal of providing a driving experience unique to the brand.\n\nSince its inception in 1989, Lexus has upheld the mindset of \"Pushing Boundaries,\" constantly challenging the conventional notions of luxury cars and consistently delivering new technologies and values to its customers. As a luxury lifestyle brand, we will remain agile and attentive to customer needs and the evolving times, unwavering in our endeavor to craft cars that bring a smile to customers' faces.\n\nDiversity\n\nOffering new values of diversified luxury, the model lineup announced for 2023 was debuted for the first time in Japan. The \"LM\" stands as a bold new option for chauffeur-driven vehicles. The \"LBX\" transcends the conventional size hierarchy and is a car for customers with a discerning sense of taste that can be driven casually. The \"GX\" combines genuine off-road capability with refined on-road luxury, and the \"TX\" caters exclusively to North American customers with its spacious three-row seating, ensuring comfortable travel. We will continue to deliver models that meet the diversified needs of our customers around the world. In response to the expectations and requests of many customers, we plan to release the GX in Japan within the next year.\n\nFurthermore, Lexus will launch a customer experience program aimed at the future practical application of the ROV Concept (ROV), which features a Lexus first hydrogen powered engine. In developing the ROV, the goal was to offer a distinctive driving experience not possible with regular passenger cars. This was achieved through a compact body size and exceptional off-road capabilities, which allows for an exhilarating driving experience and a chance to connect with the grandeur of nature. By using a hydrogen engine, the ROV aims a balance between environmental consciousness and the thrill of feeling the heartbeat of an engine. ROV utilizes low environmental impact technologies in its vehicle components thanks to the cooperation of partner companies who share the same vision. Lexus will continue to provide a variety of experiences that allow customers to enjoy the outdoor lifestyle, based on the idea of \"inspiring a deeper love and understanding of nature\". Additionally, Lexus will use the opinions collected through customer experience programs as feedback to further advance future technological developments for practical applications.\n\nElectrification\n\nLexus will continue its efforts to achieve a carbon-neutral society, centered around battery EVs. As a car manufacturer, we will also provide new services and joy of driving. For about 10 years, Lexus has been working on enhancing the basic performance and characteristics of its vehicles as well as refining the taste of the Lexus' driving signature. This driving expereince will of course be carried forward with the battery EV and taken to an even higher level with our electrification technology. The core technologies we have been working on include seamless drive force control with the DIRECT4 four-wheel drive system and the Steer-by-Wire system, which provides an intuitive, linear steering feel. We will continue to pursue a natural dialogue between driver and car that evnokes the joy of driving. In addition, with the AE86 and the RZ Sports Concept which were unveiled at the Tokyo Auto Salon this January, we are rethinking new ways to inspire the love of driving and cars, even with battery EVs, as we work towards becoming a carbon neutral.\n\nFurthermore, through the Lexus Electrified Sport Concept, we will drive the development of future electrification technologies such as all-embracing batteries, aerodynamics, weight reduction, and high rigidity.\n\nIn addition, we will take on the challenge of sustainable initiatives that consider the natural environment. Without being bound by conventional values of luxury, we will utilize recycled and man-made materials to create new, high-quality interiors. Furthermore, in preparation for the full-fledged adoption of battery EVs in the future, the \"Lexus Electrified Program\" will deploy BEV concierges at all 186 dealers*3 to assist customers with any problems they may have. Additionally we will be expanding the charging infrastructure, enhance services and provide experiences that enrich our customers lifestyle.\n\nIn 2026, Lexus will introduce a next-generation battery EV with a revolutionary modular vehicle body structure, a drastically changed production method, and a completely renewed software platform. This concept model will be unveiled at the Japan Mobility Show in October of this year as part of Lexus commitment to changing the future of automobiles through electrification.\n\n(1) ROV Abbreviation of Recreational Off-highway Vehicle. The ROV is a concept vehicle featuring excellent response and an exhilarating engine sound that stimulates the senses. By venturing into places where even off-road vehicles cannot go, it aims to offer an enjoyable driving lifestyle by interacting and coexisting with nature.\n\n(2) Details to be announced\n\n(3) As of Aug, 2023\n\nFor more information, visit https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/lexus/39765292.html.",

        "summary": "NEW YORK (AP) — Actor and philanthropist Michael J. Fox won this year's Elevate Prize Catalyst Award, which the 'Back to the Future' star plans to use to further his foundation's work to find treatments for Parkinson's disease.\n\n\nFox, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the age of 29 in 1991, received the award at the Clinton Global Initiative, or CGI, conference on Tuesday in New York. The annual prize, which went to \nNobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai\n last year, includes $250,000 from the Elevate Prize Foundation and support to amplify the winner's messaging.\n\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who interviewed Fox onstage at CGI, credited him with research advances in understanding Parkinson's. 'I don't think this work would have made the progress it has if Michael hadn't been so open,' she said.\n\n\nFox said that once he got support from his family after his diagnosis, he did not hesitate about going public with his diagnosis.\n\n\n'There's such shame associated with this illness,' Fox said. 'It's so ridiculous, this great need to keep it secret. The cruel thing of it is it's going to out you eventually.'\n\n\nHowever, he said there is no choice but to 'keep trying to move the ball forward — whether it's world peace, climate change or this disease.\" \n\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton said he was 'awestruck' by Fox. 'I've known Michael J. Fox for a long time, and he looks better every time I see him,' he said. 'He is a brave, good man.'\n\n\nJoseph Deitch, founder of The Elevate Prize Foundation, called Fox 'a lightning rod for good,' as he presented him with the award.\n\n\n'He is an icon,' Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina García Jayaram told The Associated Press in an interview. 'He was able to use the power of his story to introduce to so many people what this disease was and make us care about it.'\n\n\nGarcia Jayaram said Fox embodies this year's CGI theme of ' \nKeep Going\n ' and was 'the perfect person at the perfect time' as the more than $2 billion Fox's foundation has raised for research since it launched in 2000 has made a major difference in the understanding of the disease.\n\n\n'I just can't think of a better person to inspire us all to face our challenges with that much stamina and honesty and vulnerability,' Garcia Jayaram said. 'It's scary to be that vulnerable and share something so personal to you and your family -- especially in his case when his job was to be a public figure. He did it anyway. Nothing will stop him.'\n\n\nDeborah Brooks, co-founder and CEO of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, said the award comes at an important time for the nonprofit. In April, a biomarker for Parkinson's disease was \nidentified for the first time\n, a 'seismic shift' that will help improve chances for creating treatments and tests that can detect the disease in living patients.\n\n\n'We're excited that this kind of recognition allows him to help us continue to keep moving at what feels somewhat like a warp pace in terms of driving progress on some of the most exciting things going on in neuroscience right now,' Brooks said.\n\n\nNew developments will require hundreds of millions, if not billions, of research dollars, as well as more volunteers for testing, Brooks said. However, Fox plans to use the award to increase his profile, as well as raise awareness about how people can help.\n\n\n'Patients and families want to be part of the solution they are looking for,' said Brooks, adding that the foundation created the Fox Trial Finder, which helps connect patients to potential testing programs. 'Often they have no idea how that manifests, and so it's always been a part of our message.'\n\n\n_____\n\n\nAssociated Press coverage of philanthropy and nonprofits receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "summary": "New York [US], September 20 (ANI): Researchers have found that people with severe psoriasis are at higher cardiovascular risk in the largest investigation to date on the association between severe psoriasis and coronary microvascular dysfunction.\n \nThe findings were published in Elsevier's Journal of Investigative Dermatology.\n \nPsoriasis is a chronic inflammatory immune-mediated illness that affects 1-3% of the global population. In this study, 503 psoriasis patients with no clinical cardiovascular illness received transthoracic Doppler echocardiography to assess coronary microcirculation. More than 30% of asymptomatic patients in the study cohort had coronary microvascular dysfunction, according to the researchers.\n \nLead investigator Stefano Piaserico, MD, PhD, Dermatology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, explained, \"Previous studies have shown that patients with severe psoriasis have an increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, there has been limited research on the specific mechanisms underlying this increased risk, particularly regarding coronary microvascular dysfunction. We wanted to further investigate the prevalence of coronary microvascular dysfunction, as assessed by coronary flow reserve (CFR), in a large cohort of patients with severe psoriasis and its association with psoriasis severity and duration, as well as other patient characteristics. Patients with a reduced CFR underwent angio-CT to exclude a stenosis of the coronary arteries, and no patients showed coronary artery disease. Therefore, all patients with an impaired CFR in our cohort were affected by coronary microvascular dysfunction.\"The study revealed that psoriasis severity, assessed by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score, and the duration of the disease were independently associated with lower CFR, along with the presence of psoriatic arthritis. Furthermore, results from the study showed that conventional cardiovascular risk factors, such as tobacco use, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus, were not independently associated with reduced CFR in patients with severe psoriasis. These findings emphasize the importance of considering inflammation and psoriasis-related factors in assessing cardiovascular risk in patients with severe psoriasis.\n \nThe findings shed light on the potential mechanism by which psoriasis increases the risk of cardiovascular complications in affected individuals, in agreement with previous studies on chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and systemic sclerosis. The study supports the role of systemic inflammation in the development of coronary microvascular dysfunction.\n \nDr. Piaserico commented, \"We should diagnose and actively search for microvascular dysfunction in patients with psoriasis, as this population is at particularly high risk. We might hypothesize that an early and effective treatment of psoriasis would restore the dysfunction and eventually prevent the future risk of myocardial infarction and heart failure associated with it. In keeping with this, some preliminary studies showed that coronary microvascular dysfunction is restored after a treatment with biologics. Nevertheless, prospective studies are needed to confirm whether these findings translate into reductions incardiovascular events.\" (ANI)",

        "excerpt": "The infusion therapy market in the U.S. is growing rapidly, driven by an aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. This article shares new market research, with a look at…",
        "summary": "By Ali Arabnejad and Kamran Zamanian, iData Research\n \n \nInfusion therapy, or intravenous therapy, which involves delivering fluids and medications directly into the bloodstream, is a widely used medical treatment for various diseases such as cancer, infections, and autoimmune disorders. The infusion therapy market in the United States is growing rapidly, driven by an aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. In this article, we share macro trends as well as trends in infusion pumps, IV sets, needleless connectors, stopcocks, IV filters, and blood transfusion sets.\n \nFigure 1:\n Market Value of Infusion Therapy Devices\n \n \nMarket Landscape, Size, And Trends\n \nWhile established players like Baxter, Fresenius, B. Braun, ICU Medical, and Terumo dominate the market, startups and smaller companies are emerging as competitors. These smaller, more flexible competitors leverage innovative technologies and delivery systems, which make them more responsive to market changes and give them a competitive edge over larger rivals.\n \nGrowth in the market is expected due to the continuously rising demand in treatments for chronic diseases, along with the multiple requirements and uses of infusion therapy in treating the rising aging demographic of the baby boomer generation. As the market expands, new technologies and delivery systems are likely to emerge, accompanied by new players entering the competition. These developments are expected to improve patient outcomes and enhance the quality of life for individuals requiring infusion therapy.\n \nAccording to \nnew market research conducted by iData Research\n, the U.S. infusion therapy market size was valued at over $3.2 billion in 2022 and its CAGR is expected to be 2.5% over the forecasting period (2023–2029). This growth can be attributed to a number of factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes, the increase in the elderly population, and advancements in technology that have made infusion therapy more efficient and accessible.\n \nFigure 2:\n Hospital and Alternate Care Growth Rates in the Infusion Pump Market\n \n \nThe Shift Of Infusion Therapy Administration To Alternative Care Settings\n \nThe major trend that is driving growth in the U.S. infusion therapy market is the shift of procedures to alternative care settings such as specialty clinics, ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), and home care settings. In the past, infusion therapy was primarily administered in hospitals or physicians' offices. However, in recent years, there has been a shift toward alternative care settings, which offer a number of benefits to both patients and providers.\n \nSpecialty clinics offer an attractive option for infusion therapy patients because they often provide specialized care and expertise in the specific condition being treated. These clinics may offer a more comfortable and personalized setting, as well as shorter wait times and the ability to schedule appointments outside of traditional office hours. This can lead to improved patient satisfaction and better health outcomes.\n \nAmbulatory surgery centers (ASCs) are another alternative care setting that has seen an increase in infusion therapy procedures. ASCs are equipped to handle more complex procedures than traditional outpatient clinics and offer patients the convenience of receiving infusion therapy without having to go to a hospital. Many ASCs are also able to offer lower costs for the same procedures performed in a hospital, making it an attractive option for both patients and providers.\n \nHome care settings are also becoming a popular option for infusion therapy patients. Home infusion therapy allows patients to receive treatment in the comfort of their own homes, which can lead to increased patient satisfaction and a better adherence to treatment plans. Home infusion therapy also allows for more frequent monitoring of the patient's condition, which can lead to earlier detection of complications and improved patient outcomes.\n \nOverall, the shift toward alternative care settings for infusion therapy procedures is a positive trend for the industry and for patients:\n \n \nCost savings: Hospitals are typically the most expensive setting for infusion therapy, due to the high overhead costs associated with running a hospital. By contrast, specialty clinics and ASCs have lower overhead costs, which can translate into lower costs for patients. Home care settings can be even more cost-effective, as they eliminate the need for patients to travel to a medical facility for treatment.\n \nConvenience for patients: Specialty clinics and ASCs are often located in convenient locations, with ample parking and easy access for patients. Home care settings, of course, offer the ultimate in convenience, allowing patients to receive treatment in the comfort of their own homes.\n \nA higher level of personalized care: Hospitals are often crowded and busy, with little time for personalized attention from healthcare providers. By contrast, specialty clinics and ASCs are often smaller and more focused on individual patient needs. In the home, care providers can offer one-on-one attention to patients, ensuring that their needs are met and their treatment is administered safely and effectively.\n \n \nThe shift of infusion therapy procedures to alternative care settings has been driven in part by changes in reimbursement policies. In recent years, Medicare and private insurers have begun to reimburse providers for infusion therapy administered in non-hospital settings. This has made it more financially feasible for providers to offer infusion therapy in these settings, which has in turn led to an increase in demand for these services.\n \nAs the trend continues, we may see further innovations in delivery systems and technology to better facilitate the transition to these alternative care settings.\n \nTrends And Growth Within Segments\n \nNow, let's discuss the trends and growth factors within the segments of the infusion therapy market in more depth.\n \nInfusion Pumps\n \nInfusion pumps offer precise fluid and medication control and have evolved from the gravity-based drips of the 1960s to the compact, agile devices of today. Portable and wearable devices are a prominent trend, offering patient mobility and enabling home-based care. Integration with telehealth platforms is on the rise, allowing remote monitoring and timely interventions. Specialized infusion pumps tailored to unique treatments are expanding, ensuring safe medication delivery.\n \nDespite challenges from the fluctuating availability of hospital beds amid the pandemic, the infusion pump market remains resilient. Anticipated growth is driven by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), syringe, and electronic ambulatory pumps. While most segments' average selling prices are expected to remain stable, innovations in hardware and software will enhance device safety and efficiency, potentially impacting market average selling price (ASP).\n \nIntravenous Sets\n \nIntravenous (IV) sets can be in the form of primary sets, including pump and gravity sets; secondary sets for simultaneous dual fluid infusion; and extension sets for added length or specific features like filters or stopcocks. The IV sets market offers diverse configurations for specialized applications, such as oncology, with safety features and accessories like filters and flow control.\n \nA significant trend in the IV sets market is the adoption of antimicrobial-coated sets, designed to mitigate the risk of infections associated with intravenous therapy, with a heightened focus on patient safety, especially in critical care and high-risk settings.\n \nAnother noteworthy trend is the increasing demand for customizable IV sets, allowing healthcare providers to tailor sets to specific needs, enhancing efficiency and reducing medication errors. Evolving regulatory standards ensure compliance, instilling confidence in the reliability and safety of IV sets.\n \nThe IV sets segment is poised for sustained growth. The adoption of antimicrobial-coated sets is expected to gain further traction as patient safety remains paramount. Customization options will continue to flourish.\n \nNeedleless Connectors\n \nThe needleless connectors (NLCs) segment plays a vital role as the interface between medical devices and intravenous access, ensuring safe and contamination-free administration of fluids and medications. This segment has witnessed significant acquisitions and consolidations among major players, expanding product portfolios and fostering innovation. Split septum connectors and mechanical valve connectors are the primary types, with mechanical valves gaining dominance in 2022 due to reduced blood reflux concerns.\n \nNLCs are available as stand-alone products or integrated with IV extension sets; the majority were sold as integrated devices in 2022, offering convenience and time savings during IV starts. The market shares of stand-alone and integrated devices are expected to remain steady, with no conclusive evidence favoring one over the other in terms of patient outcomes, as well as their minimal cost differences. The U.S. NLC market includes antimicrobial and conventional non-antimicrobial devices, with the latter dominating in 2022 due to lower costs and extended disinfection duration for antimicrobial connectors. High costs and extended contact time constraints are expected to limit the growth of antimicrobial NLCs.\n \nClosed-system transfer systems (CSTS), a subset of NLCs, are gaining prominence, enabling safe substance transfer while protecting healthcare workers. These trends reflect a commitment to patient safety and workplace security in healthcare.\n \nThe NLC segment is poised for continued growth as healthcare stakeholders prioritize patient safety, infection control, and the reduction of healthcare-associated infections. The ongoing trend of acquisitions and consolidations among industry leaders is expected to drive innovation and expand market reach. The integration of advanced infection prevention features and the adoption of closed-system transfer systems reaffirm the commitment to providing safe and effective intravenous access in diverse healthcare settings.\n \nStopcocks\n \nStopcocks are vital components in complex IV lines used in surgical and critical care scenarios, facilitating simultaneous medication infusions and fluid mixing. Sold as stand-alone add-ons, manifolds, or integrated with extension IV sets, they are typically constructed from translucent plastics and silicone to control bacterial formation. These devices come in various configurations (one-way, two-way, three-way, and four-way) with ergonomic handles and different arm handle colors for fluid distinction, diverse port designs (short nut, long nut, luer slip, and all-female ports), and additional features like port protection and color-coded caps. In the U.S. stand-alone IV-line stopcock market, four-way stopcocks are the largest segment, followed by three-way stopcocks, while one-way and two-way stopcocks have a smaller market share. The product mix is expected to remain relatively stable, with four-way stopcocks potentially experiencing slight growth.\n \nThe stopcock segment is poised for continued growth, driven by the pursuit of precision and safety in fluid control within the medical field. Ongoing innovations in design and materials are expected to enhance the performance and reliability of stopcocks.\n \nIV Filters\n \nSeveral influential trends are shaping the IV filter market and fueling its growth. One key trend is the development of specialized membranes within IV filters (typically featuring a 0.2-μm pore-type membrane for bacteria and a 1.2-μm \"mesh\" membrane for lipids), enabling precise particle removal tailored to specific filtration needs, such as eliminating bacteria, air microbubbles, or lipid clusters from intravenous solutions. This specialization enhances the effectiveness of IV filters, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. Ongoing research and development efforts are expanding IV filter capabilities, with a focus on establishing the link between filtered solutions and improved patient recovery rates, reinforcing the importance of these devices in modern healthcare. IV filters are versatile, finding applications in various medical scenarios from standard medication filtration to specialized needs like blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition (TPN), ensuring their indispensability in a wide range of medical treatments.\n \nThe IV filter segment is poised for continued growth as healthcare providers prioritize patient safety and treatment efficacy. Specialized membranes and ongoing research are expected to drive advancements in IV filter technology, improving their ability to filter a wide range of intravenous solutions effectively. As the evidence supporting the benefits of IV filters continues to mount, their significance in ensuring patient health and enhancing the quality of care delivered in healthcare settings will only grow.\n \nBlood Transfusion Sets\n \nBlood transfusion procedures rely on specialized IV sets with blood filters for safe and efficient blood and blood product transfer. These sets facilitate filtration, reducing microaggregates (20 to 200 µm) during the process, ensuring safe transfusions. Blood collection IV sets are designed with shorter lengths, IV bag connections, and thicker needles. In addition to filtration, IV tubing for blood administration requires filters (40 to 260 micron) and often features a dual-spiked configuration for testing.\n \nThere is a growing emphasis on incorporating warming technologies within transfusion equipment to enhance patient comfort and procedure efficiency, ensuring blood products are administered at the optimal temperature.\n \nThe U.S. market for blood transfusion sets comprises single-chamber and dual-chamber sets, with dual-chamber sets dominating the market due to their ability to deliver two medications simultaneously or sequentially in critical care settings, while single-chamber sets serve routine treatments in non-critical care settings.\n \nThe blood transfusion set segment is expected to maintain steady growth in the coming years, driven by the persistent demand for blood products and ongoing advancements in transfusion technology. The integration of warming technologies and the development of innovative transfusion equipment are poised to further improve the patient experience and the efficiency of blood transfusion procedures.\n \nChallenges And Limiting Fac",

        "summary": "BRIGHTON, Colo. (AP) — Trial is expected to open soon against two police officers charged in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a Black man who was forcibly detained while walking down a street near Denver. After jury selection is wrapped up Wednesday, lawyers for the two sides are expected to paint contrasting pictures of the struggle between the officers and the 23-year-old unarmed man as he walked home from a convenience store. The two officers have pleaded not guilty to charges of criminally negligent homicide, manslaughter and assault. The trial is expected to last about a month.\n \n \nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The \"Augmented Reality Microscope\" (ARM) device externally resembles an ordinary microscope but with AI enhancements to its overlay visual indicators in real-time, helping discern specific findings of cancer cells or the like.\n\nTechnological upgrades or AI-based microscopes and other medical tools are helping doctors and other professionals classify samples and identify the presence of cancer cells or pathogens.\n\n AI-Based 'Augmented Reality Microscope' for Cancer\n\n has created a prototype of the Augmented Reality Microscope, a device that the company first teased in 2018, now incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) upgrades to the equipment.\n\nIt not only helps in classifying samples better but also helps in looking into the presence of cancer cells or pathogens.  and the Department of Defense hope to apply it for future needs.\n\nARM-equipped microscopes can provide visual feedback, which includes text, arrows, heat maps, contours, or animations designed for each unique assessment goal.\n\nAccording to Engadget, 13 prototypes from  are already being tested before it is made available to clinicians.  Health's efforts will enable ARM distribution through the military, hoping it could be available to some government users sometime this fall.\n\nRead Also: FDA to Explore Artificial Womb Technology to Save the Lives of Very Premature Babies\n\n, Department of Defense's AI-Based Microscope\n\nMachine learning powers this ARM, allowing the technology to be \"retrofitted\" into existing light microscopes, which most hospitals and clinics own.\n\nAccording to reports, the Defense Department is partnering with companies to integrate cutting-edge technology to speed up diagnostics in military hospitals. Future ARM is expected to cost between $90,000 and $100,000.\n\nUsing AI for Health Technology\n\nAI is powerful, and various indications from studies, research, and findings in the past only show how it can be applied to different fields and thrive.\n\nAnother AI-powered solution is also under development in the health tech sector, and this is coming from GE HealthCare, which recently announced that it received backing from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for its AI-assisted ultrasounds.\n\nWhat is good about AI in health tech is it is not disruptive, and many developments now do not put the weight of a person's life on the line for the machine.\n\nResearchers and medical professionals co-develop AI to apply in helping various needs in the health industry, with one looking to combat infectious diseases in the global south via new applications.\n\nAI's application to health technology is booming now as machine learning developments look to bring additional hands, eyes, and detection to doctors via new tools or equipment.\n\n and the Defense Department's latest development centers on the Augmented Reality Microscope, an equipment capable of detecting cancer, hoping to stop the progression of the disease.\n\nRelated Article: This Common Sweetener Was Found to Have Caused Learning and Memory Deficits\n\nⓒ 2023 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

'I'm not aware of any other individual firm out there whose focus is to work at the intersection of nonprofit and private sector on human rights and humanitarian work. It's a niche practice. The need is profound and will get more profound in years to come.'\n\nSince joining DLA in 2003, Genser has cultivated this niche practice, advising individuals and foundations looking to create humanitarian projects in developing countries. But being at a large firm limited his ability to do humanitarian work for organizations with limited resources, he says.\n\nGenser also heads Freedom Now, a boutique firm he founded in 2001 to advocate on behalf of imprisoned dissidents. In 2007, Genser helped free a former Harvard classmate, Yang Jianli, a Chinese dissident detained on charges of being a spy for Taiwan.",

For some bands, this sometimes leads to people yelling things like '\"sellouts\" and the ever popular, \"well, they used to be cool, but now they suck\". Normally, these people have no clue what they are talking about and are just following whatever 'scene' or fad is 'in', currently. Anyone who can listen to MewithoutYou and call their newest release a 'sellout record' is, in my honest and unbiased opinion, musically misguided. People who say this probably only liked MewithoutYou because Aaron 'shouted a lot'. Weiss has completely abandoned his sing-shout vocal stylings of his early years in favor of straight singing. And never before has his voice worked better with the music.This album is by far the most focused, elegant, engaging, bizarre, accessible, emotional, epic, restrained and all-around amazing album that the humble boys of MewithoutYou have ever crafted. And that is saying a lot. It was my most anticipated album of '09, and in no way at all did it let me down. Every single song of this release bleeds so such conviction, it's at times, almost unbearable. In the most beautifully moving way possible, of course. It truly seems as if every word sang and every note played has a divine purpose behind it. That is truly hard to come by in todays' music industry plagued by un-emotive, run-of-the-mill 'artists' who sing about their simply unbearable breakups and how much they hate their government while strumming the same power chords over and over...and over. And God forbid they throw in any instrument aside from electric guitar, bass and drums. Oh, and don't forget the ever-popular piano and acoustic guitar driven 'heartfelt ballad', which is essentially the same song you have listened to the whole record, just at a slower pace.Now, part of me doesn't want to review each song separately, but I feel that is the only way to truly get across just how good every single one of these songs are. Truthfully, there are quite a few songs I like more than others, but every single song is a wondrous journey into the heart and mind of Mr. Weiss. Riddled with vivid imagery of food and animals, almost as if most of the songs are fables and parables put to song. This is something that I believe only MewithoutYou can do without coming off as childish or semi-pretentious. Now, onto the separate songs.The album opens with a track that could have possibly fit very well on their third album 'Brother, Sister'. 'Every Thought, A Thought Of You' isn't one of my favorite songs on the album, but it is still exceptional. The first thing long-time fans might notice is that Weiss is very simplistic lyrically in this song. But this is, in no way, a bad thing. He gets his point across incredibly well for how simplistic his words are. It also has a very catchy 'da-da-da-da-da' chorus that is really enjoyable. The outro is also insanely entertaining. 'The Fox, The Crow and The Cookie' is the song that would be best fit for a single. It is an undeniably catchy little ditty that tells a very lighthearted story about, what else, a fox and a crow. This is also the track where you really begin to notice how experimental they have become with their instrumentation. Incorporating the fiddle and (believe it or not) a tuba into the mix. The final statement of the song also reaffirms Aarons' status as my favorite lyricist of all time. \"When letting all attachments go, is the only prayer we know...may it be so, may it be so.\"'The Angel Of Death Came To David's Room' is a personal favorite of mine. It is a very simplistic song about our unwillingness to accept death. It builds and builds and builds until it finally reaches an epic climax of Weiss and a slew of other vocalists (one of which I believe to be Scott Krueger of The Pslaters) proclaiming \"Come now David where is everybody going?\". Which brings to one of my favorite things about this album. The majority of the songs actually reach an utterly satisfying and powerful climax that sums up everything the song was trying to get across. Again, a rare feat in todays music industry. 'Goodbye, I' is another song in the same vein as 'Every Thought...'. I enjoy this one quite a bit better, though. It flaunts a predictable song structure that works exceptionally well for the song. Again, reaching a very satisfying climax. This song also includes some of my favorite guitar and bass work courtesy of Michael Weiss and Greg Jehanian, respectively; AND one of my favorite lines from the album. \"There's a movement in our stillness and however much we move we are bound to stand completely still...so let's all stand completely still.\"'A Stick, A Carrot, A String' is far from the most interesting song musically, but it is phenomenal lyrically. Telling the story of Jesus' birth from the perspective of the barn animals, in the beginning. Then telling the story of Jesus' prayer in the garden before His crucifixion. This song easily boasts some of the best lyrics one will ever hear from MewithoutYou.\"and the snake perked upwhen he heard You ask\"if you're willing thatthis cup might passwe could find our way back homemaybe start a family all our own\"\"but does not the Father guide the Son?not my will, but yours be done.what else here to do?what else me, but You?\"and the snake who'd held the worlda stick, a carrot and a stringwas crushed beneath the footof your not wanting anything.\"'Bullet To Binary (Pt. 2)' is the only song you will hear on this album that even has a little shouting. This is a superb song and has some of the strongest overall instrumentation on the entire CD. As Aaron croons, \"We all well know, we're gonna reap what we sow\", it comes across as a baffling statement of poignancy and power. 'Timothy Hay' is a VERY uplifting and playful song. In a way, I actually believe it is my favorite from the album. I think it is because of the sheer hopefulness it brings with it. It ends with with Aaron joyfully singing \"What a beautiful God there must be\", and he sings it with such conviction that I believe it could make the most cold-hearted of Atheists break down and weep. 'Fig With A Bellyache' is, dare I say it, the strangest song MewithoutYou has ever crafted. But it's appeal is undeniable. Aarons' rhyming schemes on this song is so brilliant that it makes up for any unbearable weirdness this song may or may not contain.The last three songs are probably the strongest of the entire album. 'Cattail Down' is one of the most phenomenal and downright enjoyable songs I have ever heard from anyone. The acoustic guitar driven verses bleed into possibly the most epic and catchy climax of the entire album. Which is pretty much the phrase 'You're everyone else' repeated several times with with some 'ba-ba-ba's\" in the background. Simply beautiful. I believe 'The King Beetle...' to be their masterpiece. Their crowning achievement as a band. Almost as if everything they have done in their entire career has led up to this. A simple story of a beetle king curious of what a burning pile of leaves is. It leads to a striking revelation of God for the beetle and he is 'utterly changed into fire' at the end. I know...it sounds ridiculous, but it is one of the most emotional songs I have ever heard, and brings me to tears on certain occasions.They chose to end the album with 'Allah, Allah, Allah'. Never has there been a more fitting ending for an album. With all of the crazy parables, metaphors and fables being told throughout the album, they decide to end it with the statement that God is in everything we see. Every blade of grass, every cloud in the sky and in all of us. There is not a more powerful statement that could be made by anyone or anything.\"It's All Crazy...' is not only the best album of the year, so far...it is easily the best album of the past five years, and the best MewithoutYou has ever done. Everything about it is quality. Everything about it is genuine. Everything about it is strictly MewithoutYou. It may all be crazy, but this album is certainly a remedy to the craziness that it also creates. I bestow upon this album my highest honor. Only three other albums have ever gotten a five star rating from from me.\n\"\nYet further from their roots\nPeter D \n|\n Andover, MN \n|\n 05/20/2009\n (5 out of 5 stars)\n\"I'll try to keep this short and sweet. If you liked mewithoutYou's first album and think that the other albums have been going downhill, then you likely will not enjoy this fourth release. If, on the other hand, you think they've only been getting better and better, than this album will likely be your favorite.Albums:1) [A -> B] life2) Catch for us the Foxes3) Brother, Sister4) It's all Crazy...\nThe albums are like a row of overlapping circles in which each has some common elements with the previous album, and each hints at the next. The band is to a point where album 4 doesn't overlap with album 1 whatsoever. I've heard some fans who complain that they miss 'the old mwY' others who rejoice that they're no longer 'the old mwY', and some (like me) who have enjoyed every album despite the fact that the band's sound has changed so much. There's a difficult-to-define golden thread running straight through their body of work, and if that's why you enjoyed their previous albums, then you can have confidence you'll enjoy this latest release as well.\"\nIndulging in the \"Opiate of the Masses\" sure feels good :)\nMatthew D. Neveling \n|\n Philadelphia, PA \n|\n 06/12/2009\n (5 out of 5 stars)\n\"I do not believe in any higher power/God but this album makes me want to, which is kind of scary and awesome at the same time. Marx said that religion is the \"opiate of the masses\" and this album evokes so many emotions in me that I feel I must've been drugged. \"It's all false...\" is a breath of fresh air and I am glad that I never discounted this band based on their religiously centered lyrics. I know too many people who refuse to listen to bands that have differing opinions than their own (especially when it deals with religion). After being introduced to this band when they released Brother Sister, I have completely fallen head over heels for their constant experimentation and innovation both lyrically and musically. Each album brings its own sound and complexity but \"It's all false...\" is truly mewithoutYou's crescendo. Many times bands try different sounds only to be criticized for their departure from the style that made them a hit in the first place. mewithoutYou's venture into an uplifting folk sound is nothing short of spectacular. Aaron's voice has greatly matured, and although I do miss the harsh tones of Weiss's screams on earlier albums, I cannot deny the melodic vocals he uses to convey some of mewithoutYou's wittiest lyrics. The album is playful with just enough of a somber undertone to make the song's build ups even more powerful. This can be shown in the \"Beetle King...\" more than any other song on the album. I can't remember the last time a song actually moved me in such a way that I had tears in my eyes...and I'm an Atheist! Just goes to show you that no matter what you believe there is an interconnected understanding of the human condition and emotional experience within us all. Thank you mewithoutYou for giving me a taste of what it must be like to whole heartedly believe in an all loving God, I can't help but indulge in the experience every time I listen to your albums.Advice to first time listeners: Listen to \"Catch For Us The Foxes\" first because it is the best blend of both their hardcore roots and their experimental sound on the last 2 albums. After that you can either go the route of listening to the hardcore stylings of, \"A-->B Life\", or move onto the haunting sounds of \"Brother, Sister\", finishing with ever hopeful \"It's all false...\".\nI urge everyone to give this band a chance. Writing them off would be a complete and utter shame, for you would miss a musical masterpiece.\"\n \n \nWhat to say...\nRyan C. Terry \n|\n Ohio \n|\n 09/04/2009\n (3 out of 5 stars)\n\"MewithoutYou is a band of refreshing talent; what is even more impressive is their ability to mend Bible references into their music in a way that separates them from all the other \"Christian bands\". Their previous albums have been a triumphant display of captivating lyrics and rough-yet-beautiful instrumentals, occasionally incorporating biblical references and metaphors. Their newest album \"It's All Crazy! It's All False! It's All a Dream! It's Alright\" is, in my humble opinion, an exception.Rather than write some big review as I might normally, I will get to the point.The vocals are significantly weaker than the previous two albums. The lyrics are to an incredible degree \"preachier\" than ever before, which many probably will have no issue with, but personally it's a bit much for me. I consider myself to be somewhat religious, but I listened to MewithoutYou because (aside from all their other good qualities) they hit a wonderful middle-ground; great music, great meaning. With this new album they unleash a very folk-sounding side of themselves which is an enormous deviation from their original formula that WORKED. While I don't discourage change, experimenting, evolving, if it weren't for the signature vocals, upon listening I would have never guessed this was MewithoutYou.\nPlease keep in mind, this is my opinion. I'm not at all trying to persuade anyone from purchasing this album, just putting in my two cents.\"\nRoot beer float in our banana boat across the tapioca sea\nJason \n|\n USA \n|\n 05/22/2009\n (5 out of 5 stars)\n\"We can talk about how this is mewithoutYou's most mature record to date or about how Aaron Weiss has made the leap to being a full-fledged singer, but what may be the most striking feature about this album when compared to previous releases is that fact that this is easily their most celebratory record to date. Where much of mwY's previous work tended toward angsty searching, this album, both musically and lyrically, embraces a childlike sense of wonder while simultaneously maintaining their penchant for penning pensive meditations on personal experiences with faith.To get more specific, the music on this album tends more toward indie pop conventions than their post-hardcore influences of the past. One can hear traces of everything from Neutral Milk Hotel to Explosions in the Sky (if you can believe that). Acoustic guitars, horns, strings & accordion are all used with far greater frequency than in the past and to excellent effect.\nAnd a note of little consequence... it sounds like Aaron was extremely hungry when he wrote the lyrics for this record.\"",

        "summary": "NEW YORK (AP) — A growing number of Americans are finding it difficult to afford insurance on their homes, a problem only expected to worsen because insurers and lawmakers have underestimated the impact of climate change, a new report says.\n\n\nA report from \nFirst Street Foundation\n released Wednesday says states such as California, Florida and Louisiana, which are prone to wildfires and damaging storms and flooding, are likely to see the most dramatic increases in premiums. But the fire that destroyed the Hawaiian community of \nLahaina\n on Aug. 8, as well as the \nhistoric flooding\n that happened in Vermont and Maine in July, are examples of events that could drive up insurance costs for homeowners in other states.\n\n\n'If you're not worried, you're not paying attention,' said California Sen. Bill Dodd, whose district includes the wine-country counties devastated by the LNU Complex fires in 2020.\n\n\nFirst Street estimates, factoring climate models into the financial risk of properties in its report, that roughly 39 million properties — roughly a quarter of all homes in the country — are being underpriced for the climate risk to insure those properties.\n\n\n'Some places may be impacted very minimally, but other places could see massive increases in insurance premiums in the coming years,' said Jeremy Porter, head of climate implications at First Street and a co-author of the report.\n\n\nFirst Street, a New York-based non-profit, has been a to-go researcher on the financial implications of climate change for years. Their research is used by Fannie Mae, Bank of America, the Treasury Department and others for understanding the potential risks to properties. \n\n\nThere are several signs that climate change is taking its toll on the insurance industry. The U.S. homeowner's insurance industry has had three straight years of underwriting losses, according to credit rating agency AM Best. Losses for the first half of 2023 totaled $24.5 billion, which is roughly what was lost in all of 2022.\n\n\n'(Climate change) is a problem that is already here,' said Todd Bevington, a managing director at the insurance broker VIU by HUB. In his 30 years of doing insurance, he said 'I've never seen the market turn this quickly or significantly.'\n\n\nSkyrocketing insurance costs are a serious concern for the small town of Paradise in Northern California, which was nearly wiped out by a deadly 2018 wildfire that killed 85 people.\n\n\nJen Goodlin moved back to her hometown from Colorado with her family in 2020, determined to help in the town's recovery. They began building on a lot they had purchased, and moved into their new house in October 2022.\n\n\nIn July, she was shocked to receive notice that the family's homeowner insurance premium would be $11,245 -- up from $2,500.\n\n\n'Our insurance agent said, ‘Just be thankful we didn't drop you,' and I said, ‘You did, you just dropped me,'' she said.\n\n\nGoodlin, a former dental hygienist who is now executive director of the nonprofit Rebuild Paradise Foundation, said hundreds, if not thousands, of people are being hit by these rate hikes in a town being built with updated fire-safe building codes and little if any fuel to burn. She knows a homeowner whose premium is now $21,000 for a newly constructed home.\n\n\nRecord numbers of Americans are now insured through state-affiliated 'insurers of last resort' like California's FAIR Plan, or Louisiana or Florida's Citizens property insurance companies. These programs were designed to insure properties where private insurance companies have refused to insure or the price for private insurance is too expensive.\n\n\nGoodlin will soon be one of those homeowners. She said she's in the process of transitioning to the FAIR Plan.\n\n\nThe number of homeowners covered by California's FAIR Plan was 268,321 in 2021, almost double what it was five years before. That figure has almost certainly increased in the last two years, experts say. In Florida, Citizens Property Insurance Corp. now has 1.4 million homeowners' policies in effect, nearly triple in five years.\n\n\nIn some cases, policymakers have bound the hands of insurance companies, leading to an underpricing of risk. For example, the most a California insurance company can raise a homeowner's premium by law each year is 7% without involving a public hearing, a process that most insurers want to avoid. Those policies, along with the increased chance of catastrophic events, have led insurers like \nState Farm and Allstate\n to either pull out of the California market or pause underwriting new policies.\n\n\nAs a result, California's FAIR plan, which was created 50 years ago as a temporary stopgap measure for those impacted by riots and brush fires in the 1960s, is now the only option available to homeowners in some ZIP codes.\n\n\n'We've got to find a way to get insurers to get back into the market, to take people out of the FAIR Plan so that we can reduce the risk there,' Dodd said.\n\n\nDodd was one of the key lawmakers trying to negotiate a bill in the final weeks of the state's legislative session to address the issue. But all sides failed to reach an agreement.\n\n\nThere are likely to be more insurance market failures in the future, Porter said, as more insurers simply refuse to underwrite policies in certain communities or go property by property. Comparisons to the National Flood Insurance Program, which is now $22.5 billion in debt, have become common. \n\n\nEven the backstop programs are buckling under tremendous losses. Louisiana's insurer of last resort, Citizens, raised its rates for 2023 by 63.1% statewide to cover higher costs.\n\n\nThis summer, reinsurance companies such as Swiss Re and Munich Re raised their property catastrophe reinsurance premiums in the U.S. by an average of 20% to 50%. Reinsurance brokerage firm Guy Carpenter & Co. said it was the highest increase for reinsurance rates since the year after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans and the Gulf Coast.\n\n\n'It's a global problem. Virtually every geography is seeing a repricing of risk,' said Lara Mowery, global head of distribution at Guy Carpenter, in an interview.\n\n\nReinsurers step in to help cover losses resulting from a catastrophe, so regular insurance companies do not take on all of the risk. In one example of a typical reinsurance contract, a $20 million contract could require the insurance company to cover the first $10 million in claims and the reinsurer to pick up the other $10 million. \n\n\nMowery added that many reinsurance firms now have resources dedicated to studying the impact of climate change on how to price catastrophes. \n\n\nThere have been other factors impacting the insurance industry as well. Inflation has made the cost of repairing homes pricier and home prices remain near record levels. A labor shortage means getting damaged homes repaired may take longer, requiring insurers to pay for temporary housing for policyholders longer.\n\n\nIn short, an industry whose business model is calculating risk based on what happened in the past is increasingly unable to do so.\n\n\n'You can no longer rely on 100 years of wildfire data to price risk when the unprecedented has happened,' Mowery said.\n\n\nWhile the intensity of wildfires, floods and storms can vary from year to year, the trend lines in these models point to more wildfire activity as well as more intense storms, all likely to result in more catastrophic amounts of damage that insurance companies will have to cover.\n\n\nFactoring in climate models and acres estimated to be burned, First Street estimates that by 2050, roughly 34,000 homes will burn down because of wildfires every year. That's roughly the equivalent of losing the city of Asheland, N.C., every year.\n\n\nGoing forward, it may become more necessary for potential homebuyers to look at the cost of insuring the property they are looking at before locking in a mortgage rate, due to the potential for significant rate hikes in the future.\n\n\n'It used to be homeowner's insurance was an afterthought when you are looking at buying a property. Now you'll really need to do your research into what risks there may be in that property in the coming years,' Bevington said. \n\n\n____\n\n\nReporter Adam Beam contributed to this report from Sacramento, Calif., and reporter Janie Har contributed from San Francisco. \n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe Associated Press is an American multinational nonprofit news agency headquartered in New York City.

        "excerpt": "An author's clash with a Georgia school district over a brief mention of homosexuality in a presentation highlights the reach of conservatives' push for what what they call parents' rights",
        "summary": "ATLANTA (AP) — Marc Tyler Nobleman was supposed to talk to kids about the secret co-creator of Batman, with the aim of inspiring young students in suburban Atlanta's Forsyth County to research and write.\n\n\nThen the school district told him he had to cut a key point from his presentation — that the artist he helped rescue from obscurity had a gay son. Rather than acquiesce, he canceled the last of his talks.\n\n\n'We're long past the point where we should be policing people talking about who they love,' Nobleman said in a telephone interview. 'And that's what I'm hoping will happen in this community.' \n\n\nState laws restricting talk of sexual orientation and gender identity in schools have proliferated in recent years, but the clash with Nobleman shows schools may be limiting such discussions even in states like Georgia that haven't officially banned them. Some proponents of broader laws \ngiving parents more control over schools\n argue they extend to discussion of sex and gender even if the statutes don't explicitly cover them.\n\n\nEleven states ban discussion of LGBTQ+ people in at least some public schools in what are often called 'Don't say gay' laws, according to the Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ+ rights think tank. Five additional states require parental consent for discussion, according to the project.\n\n\nLegislation restricting LGBTQ+ rights gained steam this year, but suppression is not new. A \nschool district in New Jersey\n, which requires curriculums to be LGBTQ-inclusive, tried to bar a valedictorian from discussing his queer identity during a graduation speech in 2021. That year, a federal judge ordered an Indiana district to give the \nsame privileges to a gay-straight alliance\n as to other extracurricular groups. Two years later, Indiana passed a law banning discussion of LGBTQ+ people in grades K-3.\n\n\nSchools nationwide have been challenged on \nbooks with LGBTQ+ themes or characters,\n and many have removed them, including Forsyth County, which has been a battleground in the politics of schooling.\n\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates say Nobleman bumped up against a moral panic fomented by conservatives seeking to roll back acceptance.\n\n\n'The idea that these folks are saying that they just don't want to talk about it at all is very disingenuous,' said Cathryn Oakley, a lawyer for the Human Rights Campaign, a leading advocacy group. 'What they mean is they don't want views other than theirs to be expressed. And they believe that that means everyone should have to hear what they believe.'\n\n\nDiscussion of straight people with traditional gender identities is everywhere, she said, and if all discussion of sexuality is going to be banned, Oakley said, 'then you certainly better not be teaching ‘Romeo and Juliet.'\"\n\n\nNobleman, a self-described 'superhero geek\" who lives in the suburbs of Washington, D.C., is best known as the author of 'Bill the Boy Wonder: The Secret Co-creator of Batman.\" It lays out the story of Bill Finger, the long-uncredited author who helped create Batman and other comic book characters.\n\n\nFinger died in obscurity in 1974, with artist Bob Kane credited as Batman's only creator. Finger's only child was a son, Fred Finger, who was gay and died in 1992 at age 43 of AIDS complications. Bill Finger was presumed to have no living heirs, meaning there was no one to press DC Comics to acknowledge Finger's work. \n\n\nBut Nobleman discovered Fred Finger had a daughter, Athena Finger. That, he said, is a showcase moment of the presentation he estimates he has given 1,000 times at schools.\n\n\n'It's the biggest twist of the story, and it's usually when I get the most gasps,\" Nobleman said. 'It's just a totally record-scratch moment.'\n\n\nNobleman's research helped push DC Comics into reaching a deal with Athena Finger in 2015 to acknowledge her grandfather and Kane as co-creators. That led to the documentary 'Batman & Bill,' featuring Nobleman.\n\n\nIn Forsyth County, the author gave his first presentations at Sharon Elementary on Aug. 21. After Nobleman mentioned in his first talk that Fred Finger was gay, the principal handed him a note during his second talk that said, 'Please only share the appropriate parts of the story for our elementary students.'\n\n\nForsyth County schools spokesperson Jennifer Caracciolo said that just mentioning Fred Finger was gay isn't the problem. But she said it led to questions from students, meaning Nobleman and students might discuss sexuality without parents being warned.\n\n\nIn the past three years, conservatives in the 54,000-student district have tried to tamp down diversity policies and \nsexually explicit books\n they view as immoral. \n\n\nThe district was sued by a conservative group called the Mama Bears after banning a member of that group from reading explicit book excerpts at meetings. A federal judge \nruled the policy unconstitutional\n.\n\n\nThe district was also warned by the U.S. Department of Education after \npulling some books\n from libraries, with federal officials saying the discourse may have \ncreated a hostile environment\n that violated federal laws against race and sex discrimination. \n\n\nNobleman's discussion of sexual orientation has nothing to do with the state English language arts learning standards his presentation was supposed to bolster, Caracciolo said.\n\n\n'We have a responsibility to parents and to guardians that they will know what students are learning in school,' Caracciolo said.\n\n\nNobleman said he was blindsided and agreed to drop the reference to Fred Finger's sexual orientation in remaining presentations that day, as well as in three at another school the next day. But by the morning of the third day, Finger started fielding questions from reporters after the principal at Sharon Elementary sent an electronic message to parents apologizing for the mention of Fred Finger's homosexuality.\n\n\n'This is not subject matter that we were aware that he was including nor content that we have approved for our students,\" Principal Brian Nelson wrote. 'I apologize that this took place. Action was taken to ensure that this was not included in Mr. Nobleman's subsequent speeches and further measures will be taken to prevent situations like this in the future.'\n\n\nAnd so, on the third day he was presenting, after a discussion with district officials, Nobleman refused to give the last two of his scheduled presentations if required to omit Finger's sexual orientation.\n\n\nMany parents have applauded Forsyth County's actions, Caracciolo said. Cindy Martin, chair of the Mama Bears, said Nobleman should be 'ashamed of himself.\" \n\n\nShe argues that a \n2022 Georgia law\n bans discussion of sexuality without parental consent for any minor because it gives parents 'the right to direct the upbringing and the moral or religious training' of their children.\n\n\n'No one has the right to talk to a child about sexuality unless it's the parent, or the parent has given permission,\" Martin said. \"Mr. Nobleman did not have permission. So he went against Georgia law.'\n\n\nMatt Maguire, a Sharon Elementary parent who had a daughter who attended one of Nobleman's presentations, said he was disappointed by the message and felt the school district was being bullied by Martin and others into 'reactionary' censorship. \n\n\nThe mere mention of the word 'gay' didn't merit claims made online by critics that Nobleman was ' \ngrooming\n or sexualizing children,\" he said, and it ignored that some Sharon Elementary students have gay parents.\n\n\n'It didn't sit right with me. It made me feel like certain parts of our community were being kept as a dirty secret,' Maguire said. 'I couldn't imagine coming from a family with gay members and reading that apology just for saying the word ‘gay.''\n\n\nPage 2\n\n\n \n\n\n \nThe Associated Press is an American multinational nonprofit news agency headquartered in New York City.

        "summary": "I don't think Donald Trump will be celebrating tonight. First off, he was being interviewed by Kristin Welker when she asked about January 6. Now Trump has always said ‘'advice from my attorneys'. He answered differently then. 'I acted on my own. It was my idea. I did nothing wrong.' He threw his defense under a freight train running at 100 mph.+\n\nHe lost the defamation case in New York — twice! His favorite judge, Judge Cannon let him know what he can't do. Spoiler alert: it isn't her usual ruling in Trump's favor.\n\nTwo legal scholars say Trump has no business running since he fits Amendment 14, Sec. 3 to a T. What's neat about this is the two are conservatives. active members of the Federalist Society, who Trump seems to revere, and this may go all the way to the Supreme Court. They're all about originalism and would understand what Amendment 14 Sec. 3 means. Since most of the judges who have rejected his arguments were appointed by him, he may be finding out the hard way that it might not have been such a good idea to pack the courts with Federalist judges.",

        "summary": "The loss of a Bismarck milk production facility has local producers pondering their futures, and the outlook isn't rosy. Owners of Prairie Farms Dairy Inc. will use the facility just for distribution.\nThe Edwardsville, Illinois-based company said the production employees lost their jobs. It also means the closest milk production facilities are in Pollock, South Dakota, and Perham, Minnesota.\nIt's 247 miles from Bismarck to Perham. From Bismarck to Pollock it's 67 miles going southeast or 104 miles using the U.S Highway 83 route. Either way, to Perham or Pollock, adds miles for transporting the milk, which means additional costs for the producers.\nThe dairy business was already challenging for producers without additional costs. Jennifer and Andrew Holle, who operate Northern Lights Dairy near St. Anthony, recently added 300 cows to their herd of 600 after assurances that Prairie Farms Dairy was viable. Jennifer Holle said they were disappointed by the Prairie Farms Dairy decision.\n \nThat seems like an understatement.\nThe dairy business requires long hours seven days a week. The Holles' son, Dawson, was the youngest person elected to the North Dakota Legislature. He was 19 when he won a seat in the 2023 House. Being aware of the challenges faced by dairy farmers, he introduced a number of bills to help them.\nOne bill passed into law allows dairy producers to sell raw milk at their farms. Another bill provided a definition of milk. These bills may be helpful, but they won't make up for the increased transportation costs.\nThe North Dakota Milk Producers Association, which the Holles belong to, has promised to pursue a solution. The association says it is 'confident' of a reasonable outcome. That would be appreciated by all the dairy producers.\nThe Tribune Editorial Board isn't sure what a reasonable outcome would be. Hopefully, the association can deliver on its promise.\nThe Holles took a risk when they expanded their herd based on assurances that proved unreliable. They deserve our support. It isn't getting any easier for the Holles and other North Dakota producers.\nA group of producers planned to meet with representatives of Land O'Lakes to discuss possible solutions. Land O'Lakes used to own the Bismarck facility before it was sold to Dean Foods and later purchased by Prairie Farms.\nIf the meeting results in some positive ideas, the state should provide as much support as possible.\nIt's a tough business, but dairy producers believe in it. We should believe in them.\n \n \n \nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!",
